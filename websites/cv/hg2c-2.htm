<H2 align=center>Part II</H2>
<P>The place seemed quiet. The rare night welcomed both moons. Xlior, the 
largest, shined with a confusing mixture of reds and yellows from both Grut the 
Old, and Hurt the New, the Suns of this binary system. Zork landed the spaceship 
very softly into the golden desert. </P>
<P>"Nice place!" - said Turn.</P>
<P>"Sort of..." - replied Zork.</P>
<P>"What do you mean?"</P>
<P>"Kind of dangerous, but don't worry... It's night!"</P>
<P>"Night!!!? What makes it dangerous?" - asked Turn with some anxiety.</P>
<P>"Little bugs! Crawl in you legs, and NAG!" - Zork said that with a strange 
noise directly from his two hidronoizels.</P>
<P>"And we are here!?!?! How long is a night?"</P>
<P>"Never know... Binary systems have confusing days and nights!" - said Zork 
very seriously.</P>
<P>"You are kidding me, right?"</P>
<P>"Right!" - and Zork smiled with Turn's relief.</P>
<P>Turn walked into the ship, took the xhe'noh projector and created a set of 
chess boards within the virtual field of that strange artifact.</P>
<P>"A game?" - asked Turn.</P>
<P>"Sure! But what game?"</P>
<P>"Chess, of course!"</P>
<P>Zork seemed a little confused.</P>
<P>"I suppose you wanted to ask what chess variant?"</P>
<P>"Right!"</P>
<P>"Anyone! I always saw myself as a meta chess player! Give me the rules, and 
let's move on!" - said Turn in an exciting mood - "Well, I remember when I 
showed you the Hitchhiker's Guide, we were playing TIDE chess."</P>
<P>"FIDE!"</P>
<P>"Yeah, yeah... FIDE Chess. What about something for a change?"</P>
<P>"Ok for me! What are your thoughts?"</P>
<P>"I always wanted to play some Space-Time variants, but never had the change 
for it!"</P>
<P>"Why? No opponent?"</P>
<P>"Nope... No Time!"</P>

<OL>
  <LI>The FIDE rules apply, except: 
  <LI>Instead of moving in Space, a King may jump back in Time. To do so, he 
  chooses an earlier board position that already occured in the game. The square 
  he is currently standing on must have been / must be empty on that earlier 
  board position or occupied by an opposing piece (in which case he captures 
  it). He cannot move both in Space and in Time. The game then mysteriously goes 
  on for the two players on that earlier board, with one more King on it. 
  <LI>The advantage is that it provides a King with more escapes in case he is 
  in check. The disadvantage is that the game will go on with one more King, the 
  younger King already present on the earlier board and the time-travelling 
  older King. In that way a player may well populate the board with further 
  copies of her Kings if she wishes to do so. However, the game ends as soon as 
  her opponent is able to capture whichever of those Kings. </LI></OL>

<P>&quot;That´s strange...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What? Time layers?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, comparing it with a cake!&quot; - said Zork</P>
<P>&quot;It´s just a narrow way to see it! The Guide talks a bit about
this...&quot;</P>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <P><em>Time is usually seen as a straight arrow moving forward. This
    movement metaphor is poor, since it only brings to the curious mind, the
    opposite sense of travel back in Time. However, there are other ways, like
    turning right or left, even go up or down in Time. Time does not have one
    single dimension, It can flow in different orthogonal ways at &quot;the same
    time&quot;. This is an active field of study at VariantsTown, where many new
    games are prepared to represent this temporal complexity. Variants where one
    player goes backward with the two colors and the other forward with the two
    colors; where both players change direction at their convenience; or where
    white pieces always go forward and black pieces backward - like anti-matter
    which can be seen just as matter going backward. Time is just like a Cake!</em></P>

  <LI>The FIDE rules hold, except: 
  <LI>Each piece is allowed to split its presence into two or more locations. 
  For example the White King can be half on <TT>e1</TT> half on <TT>h1</TT>. 
  <LI>Moving part of a piece costs the same fraction of a move. Before the 
  opponent plays, a player must spend the exact amount of 1 move, possibly split 
  among several fractions of pieces. For example White first move can be 
  <TT>1.(1/4)d4 (2/4)Nf3 (1/4)Nh4</TT>, resulting in the following board (where 
  <TT>1y</TT> means <TT>1y/4</TT>):

  <LI>A piece or part of a piece can land on a square already occupied by the 
  same kind and color of piece, adding the moving fraction to the fraction 
  already there. 
  <LI>It is possible to collect a fraction of a piece bigger than <TT>1</TT> 
  onto the same square. 
  <LI>A piece or part of a piece can only land on an 
  enemy piece or part of an enemy piece - and capture it - if the attacking 
  fraction that is moving is bigger than or equal to the enemy's fraction. 
  <LI>When several fractional moves contribute to a player's unit of move, they 
  are most often described as an ordered sequence of consecutive fractional 
  moves, but some of them may be achieved simultaneously, for example to achieve 
  an attack that would not be possible sequentially. 
  <LI>Beside, the FIDE rules hold as if there was no fraction. Therefore a 
  square cannot contain parts of pieces of different kinds or colors. And 
  fractional pieces are no ghosts -- they are obstacles like any complete piece. 

  <LI>There is no Check, Checkmate and Stalemate rule. The goal is to capture 
  all (the fractions of) the opponent's King. 
  <LI>The players may decide in advance to restrict the set of available 
  fractions, for example to {0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1}. </LI></OL>

K/8a8</TT>, but White can easily capture it all immediately. It seems better for 
the Black King to capture one half of a Bishop and to reunite itself with

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><EM>The default Chess board limits itself into two dimensions, those 
    called ranks and columns. However, since Space is multidimensional, there is also a set of Chess games with other connections
    made between the squares where pieces lies. A simple sample are those 
    variants where a third dimension is added. Some ancient legends talk about a 
    game, in the Onyx system, with 65536 dimensions and just a King on each 
    side. The looser is the player who, after some finite turns, cannot find his King on

    <P><I>Boards are the archetype of Space. Different boards reflect on 
    different Universe topologies, and their connectivity induces the Laws that

    our own conceptual boards are not plane! After many theoretical efforts to 
    explain this curvature in Space-Time, the only

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><EM>A chess King read an old book, where a Red Queen, in order to exercise 
  her mind, thought daily about a couple of impossible things just before 
  breakfast. For his royal intellect, he thought, that would be easy to do and 
  he started to create impossible games to see his servants play them. After 
  some months of hard times trying to learn and waste time with those strange 
  games, his Minister approached the King and said the following: "Your Majesty, 
  I'm very happy about your ideas and wonderful games, but isn't that a trivial 
  task for someone so wise and powerful? You, my Liege, could aim at higher goals!". The King was surprised. "What is more difficult than an impossible game?", he 
  asked. "Creating a number of possible rules to 
  achieve an impossible game is hard, but creating an 
  impossible number of rules to achieve a possible game is even harder!", the Minister answered. "I have 
  an idea", the King said, "I will create an impossible number of rules to 
  define a possible game". "Magnificent idea, my King", the Minister said, "You 
  are a true genius!", "I know, my honest Minister, I 
  know...". Then the King went to his castle and stayed there until the 
  brightest Sun of the System got old and red and hotter, expanded and consumed 
  his world, the castle, the King and the fading memory of his wise 
  Minister.</EM></P>
