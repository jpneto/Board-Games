  challenge</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<!--mstheme-->  <font face="arial, helvetica"><p>You can make a chess variant (CV) by changing the FIDE
  rules in one or more ways, like the shape of the board, the movement of the pieces or the
  number of players. What we (Joao Neto and Ralph Betza) propose here is to make a game
  where the change happens in an unexpected point, the arrow of time! </p>
  <p>The idea of retrochess would be to make a CV where you start with an empty board (an
  impossible FIDE position) or with just both kings (a FIDE draw) and start playing
  backwards. That is, the possible retraction moves of retrochess would be untakes, unmoves,
  uncastles and so on... (if you don't want to read the discussion, check the final rules
  for Progressive <a href="#ProgRules">RetroChess</a>)</p>
  <p>In other words, you would play a game where every move was a retraction of a previous
  legal move, using the principle of retroanalysis. Until now, retroanalysis has been used
  in problems, but never to try to play a game! </p>
  <p>The basic rules of Retrochess are: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Every position in the game must be a legal chess position that could be reached by a
      series of legal moves starting from the initial position of FIDE Chess. An exception is
      made for the first move, when the board is empty and the players must place their Kings.</li>
    <li>A move is made by retracting a move: you must look at the current position and imagine
      the previous position and the move that was made to create the current position. The move,
      the current position, and the previous position must all be legal.</li>
    <li>You retract the move you have chosen and now it is the other player's turn to unplay a
      move.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Here are a few examples of situations that may arise: </p>
  <p>a) legal back moves </p>

  <p>white cannot unmove his queen to g3, because it creates a illegal FIDE position (black
  is in check, but it is White's move). </p>

  <p>After the announce in Hans Bodlaender pages, we get some comments: <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
  <dd><i>I saw your writeup of Retrochess on Hans's CV web site.&nbsp; I was intrigued because
    I had been thinking of the same idea myself.&nbsp; I would be interested in playing Retro
    by e-mail, once a set of cohesive rules is established. In the meantime, here are some
    random thoughts I had about the rules.&nbsp; Let me know what you think!</i></dd>
  <dd align="right"><i>- Mike Smolowitz (penguin2@ma.ultranet.com)</i></dd>
  <p>[Mike]You could say that you can't win until your opponent has all of his/her pieces on
  the board.&nbsp; But that probably wouldn't work so well.&nbsp; Doing all the untakes at
  the beginning would make for a very unlikely bloodbath, if you looked at the game going
  forwards; but at least it would be legal. </p>
  <p>[Ralph] Right, so maybe if you had to make one uncapture every 2 moves, or something
  similar? </p>
  <p>[Joao] I like it! Perhaps that should be agreed by the players, and the rules could
  give a default value. That value could even be used as a compensation in stronger vs
  weaker player games (not usual in chess, but typical in go) </p>
  <p>[Mike] Sure, why not.&nbsp; If it were more than every 3 moves, for instance, then the
  game would be very long - at least 60 moves each (15 uncaptures x 4 moves per
  uncapture).&nbsp; A cycle of 2 or 3 should be enough.&nbsp; And doing all the uncaptures
  at the beginning of the game might be interesting too. </p>
  <p>[...] I have also thought about retro-strategy.&nbsp; I would tend to do my untakes in
  my back rows, so that the new enemy pieces have a long way to travel home (especially the
  pawns).&nbsp; I might untake many pawns in the a (or h) column, so that my opponent would
  be forced to bring the pawns home by a series of untakes to get them in different
  columns.&nbsp; The king would be a powerful piece in Retro:&nbsp; you can walk into check,
  and force your opponent to undo the check.&nbsp; Done properly, you could advance your
  king toward his home square while forcing your opponent to waste moves undoing checks. </p>
  <p>One other bit of strategy I thought of might have to be prohibited by a special
  rule.&nbsp; Under the rules mentioned so far, it's OK to leave a piece on an opponent's
  home square, preventing him/her from reaching the complete initial position.&nbsp; It's
  not like the opponent can take the piece that's in the way. This is legal in backgammon,
  but the difference is that it's possible for the opponent to hit a single blot.&nbsp; How
  would we prevent this approach?&nbsp; We can't ban pieces from the 7th and 8th rows.&nbsp;
  What about a variation of check: if a piece can reach its initial square, and an enemy
  piece is on it, that enemy piece must move right away.&nbsp; That's off the top of my head
  as I write this; I don't know what the ramifications would be. We need some kind of rule
  to prevent both sides lounging around in their 7th and 8th ranks, just as we need a
  mandatory untaking rule. </p>
  <p>Other oddities:&nbsp; after uncastling, the king and the rook are frozen!&nbsp; You
  can't move them, because that would invalidate the castle that's already happened.&nbsp;
  The castling restrictions regarding check are still the same. </p>
  <p>[Ralph] Since you demonstrate that uncastling may be undesirable, I am tempted to make
  it forced. </p>
  <p>[Mike] How about &quot;un passant&quot;?&nbsp; For instance, a black pawn moves from a3
  to b4, leaving a white pawn at a4.&nbsp; This forces white to immediately move the new
  pawn from a4 to a2! </p>
  <p>Other obligations might arise.&nbsp; If white moves pawns back to b2 and d2, and there
  is a dark-square white bishop already on the board, then it can't reach c1.&nbsp; So it
  must be un-underpromoted (underdemoted?), or else black has to untake the bishop on
  c1.&nbsp; And black might choose not to cooperate. </p>
  <p>[Ralph] Wow! That's a three-exclamation-point winning tactic. Black must cooperate
  because of the requirement to make a legal uncapture, and must do so without delay or else
  his piece from c1 might have a long journey home. However, is it a winning tactic? The
  promoted Bishop must become a Pawn on the 7th rank, so White also has some disadvantage,
  which might well be larger. If nothing else, this is a way to make a position more
  complicated and difficult. If you have several of these situations and some tripled Pawns,
  finding a legal unmove could be very hard; and deciding whether your opponent's unmove was
  legal could be equally hard. </p>
  <p>[Joao] About unpromotion: should it be a good strategy to untake 10 knights? or 10
  bishops? </p>
  <p>[Mike] Yes and no, IMO.&nbsp; It would force your opponent to unpromote all the extra <br>
  pieces, but he/she could easily retaliate by doing the same to you.&nbsp; So if your
  opponent uses this approach as much as you do, then all it does is slow down the game
  without giving either side an advantage.&nbsp; Maybe we should only allow uncaptures that
  don't create extra pieces (or two bishops on the same color square). </p>
  <p>[Joao]We should try the game with the least possible move restrictions! </p>
  <p>[Mike] I agree!&nbsp; It wouldn't be as much fun to play if you had to constantly check
  <br>
  a long list of restrictions before each move.&nbsp; I'd like to allow at least some dirty
  tricks. :)&nbsp; Making things difficult for the opponent is a natural part of the
  strategy - especially if you can't remove the opponent's pieces! </p>
  <a HREF="#top"><p align="right">back to top</a></p>
<!--msthemeseparator-->  <p align="center"><img src="barrulee.gif"></p>
  <dd><br>
    <b>Progressive ideas</b> <p>[Ralph] There should also be a shorter way to win, I think. Of
    course, if a game takes too many moves, people can play Progressive! </p>
    <p>[Joao] That's a good idea! But in this case, Progressive Orthodox moves (both players
    move the opponent pieces) </p>
    <p>[Mike] Well, I'd be content to try basic Retro first.&nbsp; We could always have basic
    Retro and Progressive Retro as separate games. </p>
    <p>[Joao] I had another different idea for progressive retrochess, here it goes: <br>
    &nbsp; </p>
    <ol>
      <li>White puts the white king on the board</li>
      <li>Black puts the black king in a legal position on the board</li>
      <li>White makes a legal FIDE unmove, then Black makes two unmoves (one black and one white),
        then White makes 3 unmoves (b,w,b), then Black makes 4 (w,b,w,b), and so on (like in
        Progressive Orthodox Chess)</li>
      <li>The winner is the one who obtains the initial FIDE setup, and that means <u>all</u>
        pieces (black and white)</li>
      <li>A player looses if he puts the board into an impossible position</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So now, both players are interested in unmoving all pieces, not just their own. It's
    kind of a race, a progressive retro-race, where you run and run just to get at the start
    line of a usual FIDE game (I wonder why this reminds me of Alice?...) </p>

<em>Winning Claim by Ted (accepted by Joao)</em>: This is an impossible position.&nbsp;
White is missing only one piece, which is the bishop moving on light squares.&nbsp; But a
Black capture (which must have captured this missing piece) has happened on d6, a dark
square.<br>

<p>[jpn] Uncapture two Bishops in the same color, means that one of them must be
unpromoted first<br>
<br>
[ted] Configurations like black pawns on b7, d7 force an uncapture of the light squared
black bishop on its original square (c8).&nbsp; Any other light<br>
squared black bishop must be promoted. </p>

<p>[jpn] What will be the critical turn? Possibly this is a game with 80-100 moves, so
decomposing it to progressive, 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12 = 78 moves Then, possibly the
first 12 moves would be &quot;safe&quot;...<br>
<br>
[ted] For the first few moves of the game, both sides were in a hurry uncapturing pieces.
&nbsp; However, once there are pawn captures on the board, one must be careful of
uncapturing too many pieces with other non-pawn moves, leaving too few missing pieces to
account for pawn captures. And uncapturing the wrong pieces may lead to impossible
promotions or pawn structures.</p>

<p>[ted] There should probably be some rule &quot;requiring&quot; uncaptures near the
beginning of the game, to speed things up.&nbsp; Otherwise the players could just move the
kings around forever.&nbsp; Of course, theoretically, this is not necessary since if both
players just move kings around, eventually one of the players will have enough moves to go
all the way back to the starting position in one turn, but that would take a long time in
practice.</p>

<p>[jpn] I believe that players will not uncapture. What's the point of just moving the
King? Anyway, there is the 50-move rule that does not permit such kind of behaviour!</p>

<p>[ted]&nbsp; Another point is that repetition of position should be disallowed, for the
same reason.</p>

<p>[jpn] The FIDE 3-repetition rule will cover it nicely, I think, since the game would
end in a undraw, something impossible.</p>

<p>[ted] I and a friend wrote some retro software a few years ago.&nbsp; You can use it to
try out some of these variants.&nbsp; The software (for Windows) is at: <a
href="http://www.stanford.edu/~hwatheod/Retractor">http://www.stanford.edu/~hwatheod/Retractor</a>.
It lets you set up a position and take back moves, and checks for illegal positions.
&nbsp; It does not detect every illegal position, but all common illegalities are
detected.&nbsp; It also won't incorrectly declare a position illegal.</p>

<p>Hmmm... maybe we could add code to allow network play of one of these retro variants
?!?!&nbsp; (Or even some how modify it to be used with one of the chess servers...) &nbsp;
Then we could try these games out.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have no time for that
currently...</p>

<p>[jpn] This means the shortest progressive retrochess must have 8 prog. moves
(1+2+...+8=36&gt;33 moves). It is impossible to have less (7 prog. moves means just 28
moves and there are 30 pieces to untake).<br>

<p>After the end of the 1st game, we got some comments from Alfred Pfeiffer:</p>

<p>[apf] Why you will start only from positions where the white king did the last move?
&nbsp; Let the player which will unmoves first decide whether white or black did the last
move.</p>

<p>[ted] I like the rule about have the first retractor select who unmoves first. In
stalemate positions these rules seem to require that the stalemating side make the first
retraction, even though from a pure positional point of view, either side might have made
the last move (ignoring the stalemate). Of course this does not apply to checkmates, in
which the last player to move is determined. </p>

<p>[apf] An extension for the rules above could be to start from any position, which is in
FIDE chess a final condition (mate, stalemate, draw because insufficent mating material),
and positions that theoretical could not more reduced (simplified) by further captures. </p>

<p>The idea for this proposal is that for each game that could occur in regular FIDE chess
(forward playing) its final position also could be the starting point for a (progressive)
retroplay game. </p>

<p>[ted] I don't understand that last condition.&nbsp; Do you mean some position where,
say, pawns are all blocked and no captures could be made by any pieces on the board?
&nbsp; I will refer to such a position as a 'blocked' position below. Also, there's really
no reason to insist we play from a 'final' position, e.g., any middle game position will
do.&nbsp; We could have players make several 'dropping' moves before starting the
retractions.&nbsp; A drop is legal if the resulting position could be completed to a legal
position in some way, even if the position itself is not necessarily legal. One way to
implement such a rule would be to allow either player to end the dropping process at his
turn and start the retractions, provided the position at that point is legal.&nbsp; Or we
could have some minimum number of required drops.</p>

<p>[jpn] Something like that would need a 3rd party to give the initial end position. But
it can be fun to undo a tied middle game, things would be even faster!&nbsp; </p>

<p>That idea can be transformed into a puzzle: &quot;<em>given an end game, find the
minimum unmoves to reach initial FIDE board position</em>&quot; </p>

<p>If some initial positions were played a lot , it could appear a kind of opening theory
to handle those notorious cases... And every retrochess tournament should have an award
for the most elegant retrochess game seen backwards (ie, a FIDE game) ok, I know I'm
dreaming... :-)</p>

<p>[apf] A further condition should be, that the first unmove should a such retracting
move that the new position does not belong to the class&nbsp; of final positions. When
starting with two alone kings (like above)&nbsp; therefore it should recapture at least a
pawn or a piece with mating capabilities. </p>

<p>[jpn] Using the previous sugestions, I can remake the rules of Progressive RetroChess
as follows:</p>
<!--msthemeseparator-->
<p align="center"><img src="barrulee.gif"></p>

<p><a name="ProgRules"></a><strong>Progressive RetroChess</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>White puts the white king on the board (see note)</li>
  <li>Black puts the black king in a legal position on the board</li>
  <li>White makes a legal FIDE unmove (with the white or black King), then Black makes two
    unmoves (alternating colors), then White makes 3 unmoves (alternating colors), then Black
    makes 4 and so on (like in Progressive Orthodox Chess)<ol>
      <li>The first unmove should produce a position that does not belong to the class of final
        positions. A final position is a mate, stalemate, draw because insufficent mating material
        or a blocked position.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The winner is the one who obtains the initial FIDE setup, and that means all pieces
    (black and white)</li>
  <li>A player looses if he puts the board into an impossible position</li>
</ol>

<p>note: rules 1 and 2 can be replaced with any position agreed by both players. This
position can be proposed by one player (or a 3rd party) or made after several 'dropping'
moves just before starting the retractions. A drop is legal if the resulting position
could be completed to a legal position in some way, even if the position itself is not
necessarily legal. One way to implement such a rule would be to allow either player to end
the dropping process at his turn (there can be a minimum number of drops) and start the
retractions, provided the position at that point is legal.</p>

<p>[jpn] Some people has pointed out that RetroChess seems rather pointless in the 1st
moves (what should a player do in the first 30 piece moves?). In order to give more
tactical interest, I propose the following:</p>

<p><strong>RetroChess Race</strong>: <em>A match is made of two prog. retrochess games
(check rules above). In each board, one player tries to delay the ending (i.e., avoid
reaching the initial FIDE position) and the other tries to achieve it! The player that
finished first in his board, wins!</em><br>
