<font face="Times New Roman, Times" mstheme><p><font size="3" face="Arial">According to <a href="r.gering@student.uni-tuebingen.de">Ralf
Gering</a>, </font><font size="3" face="Arial">Gothic Checkers is actually known
as &quot;Altdeutsche Dame&quot; (or in Old German:&quot;Damm-Spel&quot;). He
also says: <i>The old books don't say how far the kings are permitted to move. A
new book by R. F. Müller which is quite reliable as judged by the other rules
it gives (of draughts variants and Salta) says that that the king may only move
one square (so you would be correct!). Another book which is even newer claims
the same but the author used obviously Müller's book as his source. The strange
thing is that Altdeutsche Dame obviously influenced Turkish Draughts (which was
invented shortly after the Turks tried to conquer the capital of the Holy Roman
Empire of the German Nation, Vienna, in 1683) which has long-ranging kings. Did
the Turks invent the long range independently? The France introduced the
long-ranging king's move in about 1650 and the new rule rapidly spread to
Germany. Perhaps the early variant of Altdeutsche Dame had indeed the short move
(as explained by you, i.e. the move of the modern Chess King), but later adopted
the long range (i.e. the move of the modern Chess Queen). Another strange thing
is that the old game books state that you must choose the move which captures
most enemy pieces. This is a rather modern rule usually associated with the
long-range. A mixture of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; rules (if the short
move is correct) would mean that Altdeutsche Dame was invented around 1650,
probably in what is now Austria near the Turkish border. It appears that the
rules are not completely known from the old sources as a German draughts expert
I met 15 years ago claimed that the rules are &quot;RE-constructed.</i></font></p>
