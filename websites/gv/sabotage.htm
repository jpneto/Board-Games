        soldier. The red King or the red soldier cannot attack&nbsp; it, since
        they must move exactly two cells (both belong to the same column). The
        green soldier can attack the King since it is the only piece on its
        column.</font><p><font face="Arial">If Red moves his King to [1], he
        makes a double threat: (a) capture the green soldier with his soldier
        (now, it can attack the green soldier) and (b) he can move down the King
        into his home base in three turns. If Green captures the red soldier,
        Red moves his King one cell to the south and wins the game in two moves.
        There is no valid move left to Green in this position.</font>

with <a href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com">Zillions</a>. Another variant to 
this game is just swap home cells. In this case, plaers need to invade the 
enemy's area to win (which seems more fun).</font></font></p>
