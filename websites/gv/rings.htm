      <ul>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>GOAL</strong>
        -The object of the game is to control as many circles as you can, by spreading your sphere
        of influence across the board. </font></li>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>PLAYERS</strong>
        - RINGS can be played by two to six players. The players sit around the board, choose
        colors, and decide at random who goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise around the
        board. </font></li>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>PLAY</strong>
        - Each turn consists of two parts. First you may place a stone on the
            board, then you have
        an opportunity to convert your opponents' stones. Place stones on the points where three
        circles intersect.&nbsp; </font>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="3" face="Arial"> The stone is then considered to occupy each of the three circles which
        form the intersection. </font></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>RINGS</strong>
        - Six stones of the same color in one circle form a ring. The stones which form a ring
        become safe and may no longer be converted.&nbsp; </font>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="3" face="Arial"> Rings are also important because they increase
        your influence on the surrounding circles. You will want to form rings to secure your
        position on the board. </font></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>INFLUENCE</strong>
        - Your influence on a circle is equal to the number of stones you have in that circle plus
        the number of rings you have which adjoin it.&nbsp; </font>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="3" face="Arial"> You use influence to convert your
                  opponents' stones, and to win the game. Each stone exerts influence on three
                  circles.&nbsp; </font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Arial"> Each ring
        exerts influence on six neighboring circles. </font></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>CONVERSION</strong>
        - On your turn, after placing a stone, you may convert your opponents' stones in any
        circles on which you have the majority of influence.&nbsp; </font>
          <ul>
            <li><font size="3" face="Arial"> To determine if you have the majority
        of influence on any particular circle, compare your influence on that circle to the total
        of your opponents' influences PLUS the number of empty spaces in the
                  circle.&nbsp; </font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Arial"> Because empty
        spaces (intersections without stones) count for the defense, you will always need at least
        four points of influence on a circle in order to have the majority. When you convert the
        stones in a circle, all of your opponents' stones in that circle are replaced with your
                  own. Although converting in any particular circle is optional, you must replace ALL of the
        opposing stones in each circle in which you convert, with one exception. </font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;You MAY NOT
        convert stones which form opponents' rings, even when you convert other stones in the same
                  circle. </font></li>
            <li><font size="3" face="Arial">You can use the influence you gain by converting to continue converting on the same
                  turn. A cunning series of conversions can have a dramatic affect. </font></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>ENDING
        THE GAME</strong> - You may choose to pass your turn, and not place a
            stone. This does not
        prevent you from converting. When all players pass in sequence, the game is over. Your
        score is the number of circles on which you have the majority of
            influence. The winner is
        the player with the highest score when the game ends. Play is not limited by the number of
        stones provided. If you run out of stones before the game ends, simply select a color
        which is not in use, and continue playing with that new color. For two and three player
        games, choose two colors before the game begins. </font></li>
      </ul>

    <p><font size="3" face="Arial">NOTE: You may place stones on
    the intersections formed by the partial circles around the edge of the board. However, you
    may not convert in partial circles, and they do not count toward winning the game. You
    cannot form rings in partial circles. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial">TIP: The first few turns of each game are of critical
    importance. First, picture the area of the board that you want to control. Then, use your
    stones to define and control the borders of that territory. </font></p>
