    hexagonal grid in the shape of a parallelogram with size MxN (both odd
    numbers and not equal). The size currently considered best is 11x9, but
    other sizes and shapes could be used. Since my diagram tool cannot draw this
    type of board, I present an example with size 9x9 (use your imagination to
    add two extra rows at one edge for a real game).</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Jade can be played on Richard's
    PbM <a href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/">server</a>. Some words from the
    author: <i>Draws are impossible. Proof: Note that draws are impossible in
    conventional <a href="Hex.htm">Hex</a>, because when a board is filled either Black will connect
    the two Black edges or White the two White edges. So I claim that when a
    board is filled, either Parallel or Cross will have won a game of Jade. For
    if you color the edges as a Hex game, either Black or White will have won
    that Hex game; and if you then recolor the edges in the opposite colors,
    again either Black or White will have won this second Hex game. If the two
    Hex games are won by the same player, then Parallel has won the Jade game;
    if by different players, then Cross has won the Jade game. Q.E.D.</i></font></p>
<!--    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Parallel seems to have a
    disadvantage if he moves first. The current rule is that Cross should go
    first, since otherwise (since Cross aims at a single powerful group) he gets
    an advantage by copying the color Parallel uses for the first stone. On an
    even-order board, Parallel has a winning strategy if Cross goes first: he
    plays the symmetrically opposite cell, using the opposite color of stone. No
    winning group for Cross can be formed then.</i></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">However its simplicity, there is a
  need for a game fix, since: <i>Cross moving to the center (or any cell on the
  short diagonal), but after that it's quite simple: play symmetrically, the
  same color stone as Parallel, mirror-reflected across the short diagonal. If
  Parallel makes a move on the short diagonal, reply with any move to the short
  diagonal (either color will do). This wins for Cross, because it's impossible
  to have two parallel groups in opposite colors connecting the same pair of
  opposite sides on a board that is mirror-symmetric about the short diagonal. </i>Mark
  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/abstractgames/message/430">presented</a>
  some ways to prevent this situation. Probably the best way is to play at a
  board with two extra rows, making it more difficult for Cross thus, hopefully,
  balancing the game.</font></p>-->
