traditional GO, there are just two opponent players, each one must defeat the other in
order to win. Things may change completely if the number of players changes. I will
consider 3 to 8 different players. In the following images, the 3rd player is red, the 4th
is blue and the 5th is green.</font></font></p>

<p mstheme><font size="4" face="Arial">After that, I'm going to approach
the multiplayer problem in two other different dimensions. The movement type and the
possibility of cooperation. Moves may be sequential (just like typical Go) or parallel,
and players may cooperate in taking other prisoners (a kind of a local alliance to destroy
some mutual enemies). The super KO rule should be enforced on every variant (no
board repetition is allowed).</font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">In Go, each player is fighting all others in the
  sense that only one is going to win. In this variants, players may cooperate with each
  other. First we must define what cooperation means:</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">a) Tactical Cooperation, means that two or more
  players may encircle and capture stones from other players. If N players capture M stones,
  each player gets the larger integer smaller than M/N stones, and the rest goes to the one
  who dropped the last stone that did the capture. At the end of game, the shared territory
  values the larger integer smaller than M/N to each player and the rest does not go to
  anyone. The proportion of stones used in the capture of each player is irrelevant. The
  captured pieces are chosen first by the last turn player (e.g., if the 1st and 3rd player
  do a capture, the 3rd player chooses first what prisoners colors he wants).</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Another way to deal with prisoners is <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=pt&lr=&ie=UTF-8&threadm=190720022256246712%25a.crossman%40oyhrlbaqre.co.uk&rnum=2&prev=/groups%3Fhl%3Dpt%26lr%3D%26ie%3DISO-8859-1%26q%3Dmultiplayer%2Bgo%26meta%3Dgroup%253Drec.games.go">presented</a>
  by <a href="mailto:a.crossman@blueyonder.co.uk">Allan Crossman</a> (which adds
  a new tension to define what player will waste a move to capture stones): <i>It
  doesn't matter who gets the prisoners. At the end of the game, the prisoners
  are simply put back in the territory of their own color, just like in two
  player go with territory counting. Only in this way is it possible for
  multiplayer go to have the same result whether territory or area scoring is
  used. I think this is a very desirable feature.</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">b) Strategic Cooperation, means that at the
  end of game, two or more players may unite their territories and prisoners (discounting
  each other prisoners) in order to get more than 5/12 of the game total points. 5/12 is the
  middle value between 1/3 (too easy) and 1/2 (too hard). If a solo victory means 1 point, a
  shared N player victory means 1/N points for each one (it does not matter which one of the
  allies has more, all players get the same points). Of course, if two alliances get more
  than 5/12 of the total points, wins the one with more points.</font></p>
