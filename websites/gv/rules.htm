to propose some variations on them.&nbsp;However, the goal is not to enhance a (nearly)
perfect game, but just to present some different ideas based on Go in order to people
enjoy the strategic and tactical endless ways of abstract games. I'm not talking
about different interpretations of the rules of Go like what happens in Japan,
China or New Zealand (!) (to read about this subject, check the <a href="http://www.britgo.org/index.html">British

  points are marked. It appears that both players placed eight stones each on
  the points shown in the game below, and Black then played first. But as he was

  <i>The basic rules are the same as in modern Japanese go, which no doubt
  encouraged players to abandon the old form. [...] The real difference in
  sun-chang go, apart from the starting position, is in the counting rules. Ko
  and seki are treated exactly as in Japan (no points are counted in a seki).
  There was traditionally no komi, so clearly Black had a big advantage - yet
  another factor favoring adoption of Japanese rules.</i>

        post-dame (fill-eye) moves in Gonnect, and a great many positions in Nim

      extra soldier to create an hexaminoe, capturing any eventual enemy soldier. In the
        left example, White can capture the Black piece by forming a pentaminoe. In the other example,
      if Black capture the top white soldier, then the white structure is again a pentaminoe and
      can capture a black stone. Therefore there is a special Ko rule, that forbids those
      pentaminoes swaps on two sequential moves.</font>

      A group is dead when it has been surrounded by enemy stones, just as in Go. However,
      rather than removing the dead group, its stones are &quot;flipped&quot; to the opposite
      color, just as in Reversi. Since no stones are ever removed, the game never repeats. The
      winner, just as in Reversi, is the player with the most stones of his own color on board
      at game end. [<em>The author says that this rule was disappointing in practice</em>]<br>
      <br>
      In the upper example, when Black drops at [1], the white pieces is not captured, but
      changes color. In the other example, after white move at [2], Black may turn all pieces
      into black, if he plays at the [3] cells.

      If a move creates dead groups of both colors, then all these &quot;dead&quot; groups are
      left on the board, and may be used to capture other groups. As soon as one of these
      becomes live again (as a result of capturing something), the dead groups of the
