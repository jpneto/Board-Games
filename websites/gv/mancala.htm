<blockquote>

<p align="left"><i><font face="Times New Roman">Mancala</font></i><i><font face="Times New Roman">
(from the Arab word naqala,
&quot;to move&quot;) is sometimes called the national game of Africa (but it is
played worldwide from Indonesia to the Caribbean). Mancala is a common name to identify a set of games with the same mechanics and
goals, much like the <a href="moku.htm">Moku</a>, <a href="checkers.htm">Checkers</a>,
<a href="gv.htm">Go</a> or <a href="http://www.chessvariants.com">Chess</a>
family.&nbsp;Mancala is possibly the oldest abstract game
concept, perhaps more than 3500 years old (there are boards carved in Egyptian
temples from around 1400BC). Mancala boards resemble the Abacus and eventually their origins may be intertwined, the latter for accounting, the former
for playing (the first example of recreational mathematics?). For more information
check <a href="http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/classic/mancala.html">1</a>,<a href="http://www.manqala.org/rules/">2</a>,<a href="http://www.compendia.co.uk/Mancala.htm">3</a>,<a href="http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Mancala.htm">4</a>,<a href="http://www.ccgs.com/games/mancala.htm">5</a>,<a href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~hansb/d.gam/mancala.html">6</a>,<a href="http://www.myriad-online.com/en/resources/awalink.htm">7</a> 
and also <a href="http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wiki-Manqala</a>.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The general rules for Mancala games are:</font></p>
<table border="0" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
      <ul>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>MOVE</b>
            - Each player, at each turn, picks the stack from one of his cells and sows it thru the board.</font></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>SOWING</b>
            - Place each stone of the selected stack into the next adjacent
            cells (one for each cell) in a counter-clockwise direction.</font>
            <ul>
				<li><font size="3" face="Arial">Some boards have, between sides, a
              special cell called the store (where players keep their captures
              so far). The player's store is after the player's right
              cell.&nbsp;</font></li>
				<li><font size="3" face="Arial">The sowing may optionally include
              one stone into the player's store.</font></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>CAPTURE</b>
            - When the last stone is dropped, if a certain condition is
            verified, the sowing player is able to capture some stones.</font>
            <ul>
				<li><font size="3" face="Arial">Captures are optional.</font></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>GOAL</strong>
        - The game ends when a player cannot move or no more captures are
          possible (usually due to cycling positions).&nbsp;</font>
            <ul>
				<li><font size="3" face="Arial">The winner is whoever collects more stones.</font></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
    </td>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Most Mancala games are just variations around: (a) the
board
(including games with two or four rows like <a href="http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/Bao.html">Bao</a>
or <a href="http://www.geocities.com/omweso">Omweso</a>)
and (b) the sow/capture rules.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"> In the following diagrams, a dotted stone represents five
stones and stores are dotted squares (only visible when sowing contemplates them).</font></p>

would be to start the game by each opponent filling up his size with his own

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">As it seems a slight disadvantage to start
but a slight advantage to have more stones on a&nbsp; player's own board, it is
possible to tackle both these features at the game start by adding one extra
stone to one of the first player's stacks. This will be especially welcome for
people who does not like draws.</font></p>
