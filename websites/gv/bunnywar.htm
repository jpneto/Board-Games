<p><font size="3" face="Arial">I believe that the capture rule should be
mandatory, since it's hard to reach a result when there are few stones on board.
Even when one player have 5 stones against 3, it is difficult to win without a
major blunder.</font> </p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Lynn answered by saying: <i>The reason I did not make initial captures mandatory is because the game would be too similar to
Albuquerque. I did add a variant to the ZRF which, instead of capturing, turns the jumped opponent into a
friendly one.  I called it "Multiplying Bunny War".  It plays fast and aggressive.
In "Multiplying Bunny War", since all the pieces remain on the board there reaches a break-over point where one player begins to totally trounce the
other.  Unless that player makes some critical mistake.&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>There are positional techniques to use in plain "Bunny War" which will help
the player gain a necessary advantage in the end-game.  Getting behind the opponent often helps to destroy a weak line of defense.  So the player
should first concentrate on avoiding being captured and working their pieces onto the far rank.  Also maintaining good positions on all the outer cells
helps with the overall game.  Basically, start working your way up both the outer files, trying to form a solid line of defense.  Once behind the
opponent, lay into the the middle of the field.  These same tactics can be used in "Multiplying Bunny War".<br>
<br>
The rules were kept simple, so that a young child could learn them quickly. The names of the games were derived by the behavior of the pieces.  During
an explanation to a five-year-old, I first used the term "Bunny".  The Bunny runs, the Bunny hops.  The child quickly grasped the rules and played an
aggressive game.</i></font></p>
