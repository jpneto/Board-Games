<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Some words from the author: <i>After several
months of analysis, <a href="mailto:Edward@margaretcho.net">Edward Jackman</a>
&amp; I have come up with a possible variant of the 5x5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe game that
may work for everyone.&nbsp; </i>[...]<i> Edward demonstrated the 'strong draw'
nature of the basic version of this game by giving me 3 moves to start and was
able to block my best attempts at winning.&nbsp; We quit about 1/2 way through
the game after all the main lines were blocked by him.&nbsp; Of course he was
only demonstrating a certain style of play where the 2nd player was hell bent on
creating a draw.&nbsp; This is kind of unordinary for about 99.95 percent of the
play I have witnessed with my board game called &quot;Pentagonal&quot; [...].
Now I'm cognizant of the fact that many games have been &quot;killed&quot; by
elite abstract strategy gamers by ripping them apart and reducing them to a
simple algorithm that removes all attraction to playing them at all. But I
believe we have found the solution that may make some of you'all think a bit.</i><br>
<br>
<i>My original variant was to use a single 'free-space' in the center of matrix,
which has the most lines or planes passing through it (11).&nbsp; So what we
have come up with is an extension of the free-space concept.&nbsp; The center
space should still always be a free-space, unless you are playing a novice and
want to give them somewhat of an advantage.&nbsp; But here is the interesting
part: the difficulty of this game can be adjustable.&nbsp; Both players then
start alternately placing free-space pieces on any position they like, accept
you cannot create more than 3 free-spaces on any line (or obviously the 2nd
player would win).&nbsp; It appears that 5 may be sufficient, but this may be
incorrect.&nbsp; Once one player wants to start playing, they place their piece
down, but using yet another equalizing rule, the other player can then replace
this piece with their own.&nbsp; Play then continues in the traditional fashion,
but since there are probably several 2 space lines in several directions, it is
probably unproductive to try and just play the blocking game by either player.&nbsp;
It is most fun when both players are playing to win anyway!<br>
</i><br>
<i>The question still in our minds is this: Just how many free spaces does it
take to satisfy the true analytic minds out there?&nbsp; Edward had proposed
that all of the major '6' spaces be made into free-spaces:<br>

<i>but we have not played this configuration yet.&nbsp; Edward has also come up
with a rather unique concept in making the outside of the matrix a 'virtual
wrap', where one side is connected to the other side, or top to bottom, and
making it a 4 in a row game, thereby circumventing a middle block, but I don't
think that will work very well. So if any of you care to exercise your analytic
prowess and figure out the best range of the number of free-spaces needed, you
may get a free copy of the game board matrix I have patented and is in the final
production run of 500 (out of 2500 total). I feel it is between 5 and 9, but
Edward thinks it is more.&nbsp; </i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>I feel this board matrix may be viewed as an
abstract &quot;deck of cards&quot; that can accommodate numerous games, most of
which have probably not yet been invented yet.</i></font></p>
