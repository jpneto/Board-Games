	<p><font size="3" face="Arial" mstheme>Those were the revised rules of 
	Forms. The original rules (from May 2007) are the following (taken from
	<a href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/forms.html">Gamerz.net</a>):</font></p>
	<div>
		<blockquote>
			<font size="3" face="Arial" mstheme>Forms can be played on any size square or rectangular grid which has an 
		even number of rows, an even number of columns, or both. Initially, one 
		entire side of the board is filled with black stones and the opposite 
		side with an equal number of white stones, all forming one 
		interconnected group, as shown in the next figure. Each player takes ownership 
		of one entire set of like-colored, on-board stones. When all of your 
			stones have been removed from the board, you win. Draws and ties 
		cannot occur in Forms. </font>

	<p align="left">The author sent me some strategy guidelines:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<div>Working through the above bestiary will serve as an excellent 
			introduction to Forms' tactics.&nbsp; (Just bear in mind that the outcome 
			is often different when the situation is at or near an edge or 
			corner.)&nbsp; Before going on to learn about Forms' strategy, it is 
			first necessary to understand why Forms is a misere game:&nbsp; the 
			all-abandoned-pieces-vanish rule means that it *has* to be.&nbsp; 
			Otherwise at the first opportunity a player will simply fly a piece 
			into empty space, abandoning everything, and win.<br>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>Although Forms is a game of elimination, it may be helpful to think 
			of it in terms of a game of checkmate:&nbsp; any opponent's piece or 
			group of pieces can be considered a &quot;king&quot; and&nbsp;a potential target 
			for checkmate.&nbsp; Try to isolate your opponent's pieces to make them 
			easier to attack --- an isolated singleton is a particularly good 
			target.&nbsp; In general you want to keep your own pieces connected, but 
			don't just lump them together.&nbsp; Instead arrange them efficiently in 
			lines and bent lines; this&nbsp;will make it easier to detach from 
			yourself and therefore give you more opportunities to make a slide 
			move.&nbsp; (Slide moves are often more powerful&nbsp;than replacement 
			captures.)&nbsp; Generally speaking, you want to have more pieces on the 
			board than the opponent&nbsp;has (except at the very end, of course); 
			again this will help maximize your slide move opportunities.&nbsp; 
			Since&nbsp;abandoned portions of the board are removed, you want to be 
			sure that the single surviving portion is a position to your 
			advantage ---&nbsp;it will do you no good to have an advantage in a 
			portion of the board that ends up getting abandoned.&nbsp; And be careful 
			not to get&nbsp;outmaneuvered in or near an edge or corner, where sliding 
			options quickly diminish.</div>
