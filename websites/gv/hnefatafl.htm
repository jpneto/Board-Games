<p align="center"><font size="3"><strong>Traditional ~ 400 AD Scandinavia</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>The game of Tablut was discovered by Carl von Linné at
Kvikkjokk, Sweden, in 1732. It is almost certainly the Old Norse board-game
known as &quot;Hnefatafl&quot;, mentioned in the Icelandic sagas. The word
hnefatafl is a compound of Hnefi (meaning fist) and Tafl (ultimately from tabula
and meaning board). The rules have been developed by Martin Skoglund, Historisk
Form, in collaboration with Inga Lundström of the National Museum of
Antiquities.</i><font size="2"> [from <a href="http://www.expomedia.se/tablut/eng/history.htm">www.expomedia.se/tablut/eng/history.htm</a>]</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>The game was popular in the Viking homelands in
Scandinavia as early as 400 AD and was carried by the Vikings to the lands they
conquered. Over the centuries the game developed and different versions of the
board have been found by archaeologists in sites from Ireland to the Ukraine.
Occasionally referred to in manuscripts the game was known as Hnefatafl which
means literally &quot;king's table&quot;. Its decline began in the 11th century
as chess grew in popularity. It soon lingered on only in remote country
districts. </i><font size="2">[from <a href="http://viking.no/e/life/egames.htm">http://viking.no/e/life/egames.htm</a>]</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> The game is played on the following board with this setup:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">This version has a big flaw, it is too easy to win
when playing the King side. There is some mistake between the real
rules (already lost?) and the written ones. You can try playing it <a href="http://www.expomedia.se/tablut/eng/oppon.htm">here</a>.

	<p wrap align="left"><font face="Arial">According to 
	<a href="mailto:mwi9%20AT%20swipnet.se">Mats Winther</a>: <i>No wonder that 
	it is an unfair game [...] according to experts at the Historical 
	Museum, Stockholm, the king can be captured like any other piece, by 
	sandwiching it between *two* pieces <a href="zrfs/tablut.zip">
	<img border="0" src="icons/z.gif" width="11" height="11" title="get this game"></a>. It is only at the center position that 
	four pieces are needed to capture it. On the squares directly adjacent to 
	the central square three pieces can capture the king, since the central 
	square is used as a capture-square. Otherwise only two pieces are necessary, 
	and one piece is enough if the king is positioned to any of the corner 
	squares (since these are capture-squares). If four pieces are needed to 
	capture the king, then the attacker's game is hopeless.</i></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">From the same website, some strategy notes: <i>The
King's forces usually possess a slight advantage, despite being outnumbered.
Tactically, the defender (King's men) must arrange for the King to escape the
board. Therefore, the defender should try to capture as many attackers as
possible to clear an escape route, while not trying too hard to protect his own
men since they, too, can block the King's escape. The attacker's object is not
only to prevent the King's escape, but also to capture him. The best way to do
this is to avoid making captures early in the game, instead scattering the
attackers to block possible escape routes.</i></font>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">An interesting way to play this game, is to
reduce the King's power so that it can only moves to an adjacent orthogonal
cell. This rule change balances things a bit more.</font>
