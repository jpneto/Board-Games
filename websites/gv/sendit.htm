<p><font face="Arial">This game is a restricted variant of Go (a player can only 
drop stones where he is able to 'see') which is compensated by the possibility 
of dropping four stones per turn. This provides a tool for quick invasion of 
almost surrounded areas, leading to complex tactical battles. The another drop 
restriction (one stone per group per turn) prevents the quick formation of 
living groups (i.e., groups that cannot be captured because it controls at least 
one cell). For example, the marked white stone at d7 and the white c8 stone are 
virtually connected, because Black cannot drop in a single turn two stones at c7 
and d8 because they would be in the same group, violating a drop restriction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Send It can also be played on a square board, using the 
same rules (adjacency is only orthogonal not diagonal). However, it is easier to 
make safe structures (to control a cell only needs four stones, instead of six). 
So, this variant was tested with the following extra rule: &quot;An isolated enemy 
stone with just one liberty can be pushed into that empty cell while the player 
drops a friendly stone on that now vacant cell&quot;.</font></p>
