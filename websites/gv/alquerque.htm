<p><i>Draughts is a very ancient game indeed, the origins of which, like Chess, aren't completely clear. However, early
forms of Alquerque, its venerable ancestor,
have been found in Egypt dating at least as
early as 600BC. Alquerque boards can be seen carved
into the stone slabs which form the roof of the great temple
at Kurna, Egypt, which was built in 1400BC (of course, they
might have been carved at any point since). The game of Alquerque
was played like Draughts on a 5 x 5 point board with the
pieces starting in a non-symmetrical pattern. The game clearly had
staying power - it is mentioned under the name of Quirkat in the
Arabic work Kitab-al Aghani, the author of which died in 976 AD.
Quirkat was first brought to Europe by the Moors during their
invasion of Spain. It was recorded as Alquerque (Spanish form
of El-Quirkat) in the Alfonso X Manuscript which was written
between 1251 - 1282 at the command of Alfonso X, King of
Leon and Castile.</i><font size="2"> [From <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/james.masters/TraditionalGames/Draughts.htm">web.ukonline.co.uk/james.masters/TraditionalGames/Draughts.htm</a>]</font></p>

Kolowisi Awithlaknannai is a traditional game of Native American tribe Zuni.
&quot;Kolowisi Awithlaknannai&quot; means &quot;Fighting snake&quot;. Kolowisi
is a mythic snake. The goal is to capture all enemy stones. White begins. First,
White has to move one of his stones on the cell in the middle. Then, black can
jump over the stone on the middle cell and capture it or move another stone.
Afterwards, players alternate turns. A stone can be moved on an adjacent empty
cell, or it can jump over (capturing) enemy stones. Multiple jumps are allowed.

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">All pieces can move to adjacent (along the lines)
empty cells. Kings can jump over an adjacent friendly soldier landing on the
immediate cell which must be occupied by an enemy piece (which is captured).
Captures are not mandatory and soldiers cannot capture. The goal is to capture
the enemy King.</font></p>

website <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/melki9/">http://hem.passagen.se/melki9/</a>) 
is a checker variant played in an extended alquerque board</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="icons/damiano.gif" width="223" height="223"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Mats Winther's words: <i>While the pattern restricts piece 
movement one can introduce orthogonal movement without making the game too 
complicated. The idea is to propose a less forced form of Checkers. Pieces move 
forward, either straight or diagonally. They may capture (jump) only diagonally 
forwards (like in Checkers). Goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. 
Pieces are promoted to kings at the last rank. Kings move and capture in all 
directions. Capture is obligatory. Stalemate is a loss. </i>The game starts with 
the initial two rows of each player filled with friendly stones.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Also on this site there is Zamma:</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="icons/zamma.gif" width="287" height="289"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Mats Winther</font>'s <font face="Arial">words:<i> Zamma (Damma, 
Srand, Dhamet) is played on a quadruple Alquerque pattern (Arabic Alquerque is 
the forefather of checkers). The Zamma board is quite old. It is believed to be 
the precursor of the Alquerque board pattern. A Zamma board survives among the 
roof-slab scribings at Kurna (c. 1400 BCE). However, the present version of 
Zamma is believed to rely heavily on developments in draughts since the 17th 
century (a supposition that could be challenged). It is still played in North 
Africa, where the black pieces are called men, and the white pieces are called 
women. When played in the Sahara, the men are represented by short sticks, 
whilst the women are pieces of camel dung. Black makes the first move. <br>
<br>
This game is called Srand (or Dhamet) in Mauritania, where it is the national 
game. In the particular variant played the captured counters are removed 
instantly from the board. In other variants the removal of captured pieces is 
deferred. <br>
<br>
Pieces are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. They can only move in the 
forward directions, however, they can make multiple captures, by the short leap, 
in any direction. Goal is to capture all the opponent's pieces. Note that one 
must always choose the line with the most captures. Pieces are promoted to 
Mullahs (also called Sultans) at the last rank. If the counter, during a 
capturing sequence, makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square, it does 
not promote to Mullah. The Mullah moves and captures in all directions. It can 
move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land 
anywhere behind the captured piece. In one variant it cannot jump repeatedly 
over an enemy piece, in another variant it can (that is, the captured piece has 
already been removed). Capture is compulsory. <br>
<br>
A piece moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an 
enemy piece and the point directly behind is vacant, then one must jump over it 
and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a 
single turn.<br>
<br>
By way of combinations one must try to attain material advantage, by exchanging 
one piece for two, or two for three, etc. In the endgame, material advantage 
generally leads to a win. Mullahs are very powerful, and one can sacrifice 
pieces to achieve promotion. Remember that men standing on the diagonal matrix 
have greater scope. <br>
<br>
This is an intriguing checkers variant. The counters have different scope 
depending on which squares they are positioned. On half of the squares they can 
capture in eight directions, in the other half they can capture in four 
directions and move in only one. The board pattern allows this freedom of 
capture directions while half of the diagonals are removed, compared with a 
checkers board. Possibly this game carries some advantages compared with 
international draughts, which has become very drawish in grandmaster quarters.
