<h1 align="center"><strong><font face="Arial Black">LATRUNCULI</font></strong></h1>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="3">Traditional - Ancient Rome</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>The Romans had a game </i></font><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>known
as Ludas Latrunculorum (&quot;The Game of Soldiers&quot;), or Latrunculi for
short.&nbsp; This game was played on various sized boards between two opposing
forces.&nbsp; It was first documented in 116-24 BC and played up until
approximately 400 AD.&nbsp; The Romans carried it to Ancient Egypt and Persia,
where it was known as Nard.&nbsp; (Not to be confused with an entirely different
game of Nard played in the medieval times which is similar to backgammon.)&nbsp;
</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2">[...] </font><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>It
is possible that this game is a descendant of the Ancient Greek game <a href="petteia.htm">City</a>.&nbsp; There is a theory
saying the
Celts picked up Latrunculi at Hadrian’s Wall and carried it north in
approximately 200 - 300 AD. </i>[</font><font face="Arial" size="2">from <a href="http://www.earthgaming.com/tabula/history.html">www.earthgaming.com/tabula/history.html</a></font><font size="3" face="Arial">]</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">It seems that Latrunculi had two
variants, an older one based on City with a setup made only of soldiers, and
a newer one which also had a King for each side. This is stated on Firdawsi’s <a href="http://www.4literature.net/Firdawsi/Book_of_Kings_Epic_of_Kings_/">Book
of Kings</a>:</font></p>
<p align="left"><i><font size="3" face="Arial">“He arranged an army similar to
that of chess, he placed the 2 sides in order of battle and distributed the
troops, ready for battle and for the assault of the town, among 8 houses. The
field was black, the battle-field square, and there were 2 powerful kings of
good disposition who should both move without ever receiving injury. Each has at
his side an army in its arrangements, collected at the head of the field and
ready for the fray. The 2 kings advanced upon the field of battle, their troops
moved on all sides around them, each trying to outdo the other, now they fought
on the heights, now on the plains; when 2 on 1 side has surprised a man by
himself, he was lost to his side, and the 2 armies remained face to face until
it was seen who was beaten.” [</font><font face="Arial" size="2">cited by <a href="mailto:RogerCoop@aol.com">Roger
Cooper</a></font><font size="3" face="Arial">].</font></i></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Ok, so we have two games. Roger
Cooper called them Civil Latrunculi (for the older one), and Military Latrunculi.
Let's use these names.</font></p>
<h2 align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial Black">CIVIL LATRUNCULI</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">The size of the board is not known
for certain.
There was archeological findings of 8x7, 8x8, 8x12, 10x9, 11x10, 7x7, 10x12 or
10x13 (!). Let's assume 8x12.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">The game starts
with 12 stones off board:</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">According to Ulrich Schändler, it is possible
that the capture would count as a whole turn - so, the soldiers used to capture
should be immobilized one turn (and of course, the capturing soldier could not
also move),
giving some chance for counter-measures.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Cooper defends that according to Firdawsi's
sentence: &quot;<i>advanced upon the field of battle, their troops moved on all
sides around them</i>&quot; may indicate that the goal of this game is to
advance the King to the last row (this is indeed related to the edge goal of the
<a href="tablut.htm">Tablut</a> family). Instead of the initial board, this is
an optional setup:</font></p>
