<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">This game is played on an empty 8x8 square 
chess board. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Use </font><font size="3" face="Arial">6 
checkers and 66 Go stones (or smaller, it depends on the size of the board, 
check why below)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Counterinsurgent (COIN) player places his 
checkers on black squares in the middle of the board, as shown. The Guerrilla 
player starts with no pieces on the board, but begins by placing one stone 
anywhere on the board, then a second stone orthogonally adjacent to the first.</font></p>

<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial">Some notes from the author (the previous rule 
text is also his): </font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial">Variant: With competent play, the COIN player will 
often lose. Players should play one game each, switching roles, and the winner 
of the match is the one who can defeat the COIN player using the smallest number 
of stones.<br>
<br>
Notes on tactics:<br>
Guerrilla player – remember the words of Mao Zedong:<br>
- “The enemy advances, we retreat.” It’s OK if you lose lots of pieces in a turn 
(and you will): as long as you have one left, you are still in the game. Play 
where the enemy can’t get at you right away. <br>
- “The enemy camps, we harass.” Exploit unit boundary confusion by playing 
between enemy checkers when you can – he can’t jump you there. <br>
- “The enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.” Your forces do 
not move but they “flow”: think of your pieces as an ever-growing web to trap 
the enemy. Deploy lines of stones to hamper his movement and trap him – he has 
to move next to you before he can jump you.<br>
COIN player:<br>
- You have the tougher job – you can mow them down but they will keep coming 
back! <br>
- Watch for any mistakes he might make – if you can completely clear a whole 
corner of the board of enemy stones, it will be a while before he can return 
there. But you must do a complete job.<br>
- Be careful of the edge of the board – any checker left there can be eliminated 
with only two stones, or even one stone in the corners, if there are enemy 
nearby. Don’t run into such an ambush.<br>
- The Guerrilla will always be setting up thin walls and traps for you – watch 
where he puts these. If he makes too large a “string” you can reduce his forces 
to almost nothing in one move.</font></i></p>
