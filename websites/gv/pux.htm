                  piece position, transported pieces - next position. E.g.,
                  b2,b1c2-c3. It means piece b2 transports b1 and c2 and moves
                  to c3 (b1 goes to c2 and c2 goes to d3) The b2 stone has 3
                  neighbors (including diagonals) which are b1, c1 and c2. That means
                  its move potential is 4 (including itself). Since White wants
                  to transport 2 neighbors, he must distribute the b2 move
                  potential (which is 4) by itself and the other 2 transported
                  stones. So, move potential which is 4 divided by 3 stones
                  equals 1.3, then after removing the decimal part, we get 1, i.e.,
                  the group may move 1 square. If b2 transports only one stone,
                  then both of them could move up to 2 squares (4 MP / 2 stones
                  = 2 squares). For e.g.. 1. b2,b1-b4</font></li>

Sagme was the Earth's 1st serious ExoLudologist. She was</font> <font SIZE="2">born
around Ulan Bator, in 2293. Since her infancy, she was very</font> <font SIZE="2">interested
by all the knowledge created and gathered in the 20th</font> <font SIZE="2">and
21st centuries about abstract board games, a subject almost</font> <font SIZE="2">forgotten
on those exciting days. Alien civilizations were finally</font> <font SIZE="2">found
across the big black sky, and Humanity had the 1st change</font> <font SIZE="2">to
read Encyclopedia Galactica.</font> <font SIZE="2">After collecting the most
important games on Earth, she decided</font> <font SIZE="2">that her life goal
would be to study the games from some of those</font> </i><i><font SIZE="2">alien
civilizations.</font></i> <i><font SIZE="2">She was one of the few people that
had the right to travel and</font></i><i> <font SIZE="2">enter into some alien
home worlds. It was no coincidence that</font> <font SIZE="2">the aliens that
allow her to enter, was exactly the ones which</font> <font SIZE="2">had more
respect about games, especially abstract board games.</font></i> <i><font SIZE="2">She
visited the following civilizations:</font> </i></p>
<ul>
  <li><i><font SIZE="2"><b>Civ-3</b>: They use trilogic as a
      foundation for all mathematical</font> <font SIZE="2">activities, i.e.,
      instead of true/false logic, they use</font> <font SIZE="2">true/false/unknown.</font>
      </i></li>
  <li><i><font SIZE="2"><b>Konn'ex</b>: They see all objects and
      concepts as connections of others,</font> <font SIZE="2">and their games
      reflect these way of seeing things.</font> </i></li>
  <li><i><font SIZE="2"><b>Zet</b>: Everything is a part of
      something. Their games, usually create complex pieces from atomic ones.</font></i>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><i><font SIZE="2">She
found many resemblances with Human games, especially in connection</font></i><i>
<font SIZE="2">and pattern games, namely, Hex and Gomoku were found in almost
all</font> <font SIZE="2">home worlds (however in different board sizes and move
equalizers).</font> </i><i><font SIZE="2">Curiously, no chess related game was
ever found! This game came from the Zet culture, and was renamed by T.Sagme in
2379. Perhaps her most famous discover was Desdemona, the Othello variant from
Civ-3.</font></i>
