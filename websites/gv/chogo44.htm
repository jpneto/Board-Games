				cannot move by its own. </font>

<p><font face="Arial">Some words of the 
<a href="http://www.chessvariants.org/44.dir/chogo.html">author</a>: <i>Chogo can be played on many 
other boards </i>[...] <i>For Chogo on fuller or bigger boards the tandem 
movement of a part-trapped contingent is different. A part-trapped column can 
move together one space orthogonally only. On the larger boards, Chogo can (and 
perhaps should) be tried allowing the king to move with unrestricted rook power. 
Other (untested) variants might allow the trapping of not just one but more than 
one man, by flanking either end of connected straight lines of enemy men.</i> 
[...] <i>Also, a different rule could be adopted when a side's men are all in 
secure structures: &quot;a player cannot both start and end his move with all his men 
in secure structures&quot; </i>[...]<i> It is quite possible that forms of Chogo 
could be developed on hexagonal (and even other) grids, incorporating other 
forms of 'phasic' immobilization/capture. Finally you might like to experiment 
with beginning the game with an empty board, and having an initial phase where 
men are successively dropped onto the board - captures might or might not be 
allowed in this phase - with the kings being dropped last (or perhaps without 
kings). </i>[...]<i> Such a game naturally begins to resemble Go. </i></font></p>
