                  but it may capture on a perpendicular direction. The soldier
                  is then called isolated in the latter direction.</font></li>

                  capture in a direction in which it is isolated. Once the

                  the rest of the turn.</font></li>

                  particular line, and next to it on that line is a empty cell

                  soldier captures the piece by making a one step approach onto
                  the empty cell (only that soldier is captured, not an entire
                  phalanx, if any). If it can proceed in a similar way in
                  another direction (including 180<sup>o</sup> turns), it must
                  do so, taking care beforehand to establish the route that
                  brings the maximum number of captured pieces. Kings count as
                  one piece.</font></li>
					<li><font size="3" face="Arial" mstheme>A King captures at any distance,
                  an opponent's piece, by sliding onto the last empty cell

                  direction (including 180<sup>o</sup> turns), it must do so,

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">From the author: <i>I'd like to introduce two
terms, tempo and pace. The concept of phalanx movement gives Bushka an unusual
flexibility in both. Both concepts tend to lose much of their meaning once kings
come into play. Pace is calculated by giving one point to each man on the bottom
rank, two points to each man on the second rank, and so on. It does not depend
on mobility or the opponent's position (though the difference in pace of course
does). Tempo is more difficult to calculate. Roughly speaking it is the number
of moves a player has available. In the opening and middle game, it is usually
the number of moves a player has available behind a frontline. Since tempo
concerns a number of moves, it may (and usually will) be affected by the
opponent's moves. [...]&nbsp; </i></font><i><font size="3" face="Arial">Making
much pace is good in an open game: you go for the back rank.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">Making
little pace is good in a closed game: you need tempo-moves behind the
front-line.</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">As far as anticipating the nature
of the game goes, the decision whether to keep men back is a strategic one.</font></i></p>
