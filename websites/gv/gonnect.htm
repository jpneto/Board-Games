            players A and B:- if the unresolved area is not central to A's
            connection, then A is safe to abandon pieces in that area and play
            around the periphery of the battle, often ending up in a superior
            position despite losing many pieces. - if A must connect through the
            unresolved area, then any captures by B in that area are bad (much
            worse than captures in Go) as not only is a potential connection for
            A removed, but B consolidates their blocking connection. Sounds
            obvious, but these qualities distinguish Gonnect
            substantially from Go.</font></p>

            types: connecting chains (to win) and blocking chains (to prevent

            block the opponent's connecting stones. A player may insert a stone
            into the opponent's structure in order to delay a connection. let's
            call it a defensive blocking move.</font></td>

            White is forced to play B13 or D13, reducing their top left formation to
            one eye and making it vulnerable. How Black can maximize their chances
            of forcing White to do this? Black must ensure they have more eyes than
            White when the eye-filling stage is reached, regardless of whether the
            eyes belong to formations that offer any connective benefit.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font face="Arial"> What about the next pattern?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">This appears to be the best way to pack as
            many eyes into as small a space as possible. Any game between two expert players
            will eventually be deadlocked, reach the eye-filling stage, then be won by the player
            with the most eyes. Of course, while you were doing this, your opponent
            would be playing on awkward places to interfere. And which
            would be more important - making 1-point eyes in your own territory
            or messing up his? We just don't know as yet!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">[Bill Taylor] Whoever has to crack first loses; which means,
            roughly, whoever has the less territory as in Go. But not
            exactly the same - there is an art to filling in one's
            own territory, and wasting moves in the opponent territory, that
            regular Go does not encompass. It has been studied for endgame-like
            positions, and leads to some fascinating Conway-style results there.
            But no-one has yet studied things for filling in very large
            territories. There are many general proverbs waiting to be
            discovered! No doubt if Gonnect (or no-pass Go) ever catches on they
            will become more well-known.</font></td>

            <p><font face="Arial"><i>About the depth of Gonnect compared to Go, I
            start to understand. There is the new dimension found in the richer
            endgame where we might need to waste time in filling territories, as
            you said. So there is also something of Tanbo in Gonnect, not only
            Go and Hex. And there is the constant threat that a connection may
            be achieved quite early. This is something decreasing the depth. We
            seem to see where we want to go and who is ahead before it would be
            possible in a Go game. But this may well be a beginner's illusion.
            The game is anyway more exciting than Go, where I'm lost with its
            early lack of tension</i>. Claude Chaunier</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial"><i>A fascinating game - part race, part
            blockage,
            part territory! I think this may be one of your prize inventions.
            But as you say, it's amazing no-one ever thought of it before.&nbsp;
            </i> Bill Taylor</font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Arial">Although Go and Gonnect have even more in
            common than I at first though--in the end, it is the player who
            constructs the strongest groups who wins, regardless of how the win
            condition is defined. It is obvious from looking at our board that
            you and I are playing Gonnect and not Go, but I think the positions
            could be analyzed without even thinking about what game we are
            playing. That is, I am about 90% certain you are going to win, and
            if we suddenly switched to playing by the rules of Go, I would still
            be about 90% sure you are going to win. There is some elbow room
            here, but I bet this would apply to most Go or Gonnect matches. And
            it is easy to see the basis of my prediction by looking at the
            board: you have two strong groups, groups which I should probably
            consider nearly impossible to capture. I have none, and it is
            obvious that my pieces were only played in response to your groups.
            I tell my friend with whom I play Gonnect, but is much less
            interested in games than me, &quot;Don't look at the board and see
            pieces; look at the board and see groups.&quot;</font></i> <i><font face="Arial">What
            makes Gonnect great--which I'm sure you realize--is the way it
            forces the players to constantly care about the move immediately at
            hand. Go is too spread out; a strong player can take it easy for the
            opening moves, like the hare racing the tortoise, knowing that they
            will ultimately win in the end game. All Gonnect does--the simple
            twist of rules--is to raise the possibility that there may very well
            not be an end game. Carpe diem. Consider we poor human beings. For
            the most part, we feel little direction in our lives, often pulled
            in multiple directions at once. We envy the characters we see in
            drama--their (fictional) lives are directed, they have a goal, and
            the plot is the essence of fulfilling that goal, there is never a
            wasted scene, or else we call it bad drama. We live our lives as
            though they were Go games, but we secretly (sometimes not secretly)
            wish they were Gonnect games. I suggested a business to my friend:
            clients come to me, name a date in the future, and pay me a few
            thousand dollars. On that date, I murder them. From now until that
            date, they live with the absolute knowledge that they will die in X
            years (or less, by other causes); anything they want to do, they do,
            because the possibility of the &quot;end game&quot; has been
            removed; for them, there is only the present. That is what you've
            done to Go in my opinion, you've taken an enjoyable game and made it
            as enjoyable as it could be.</font></i> - <font face="Arial">Chris

            <p><font face="Arial">Gonnect is not just a variant of Go.&nbsp; What happens is that Go
            and Gonnect both use a common set of rules, namely, those for
            capturing with no liberties, Ko, ..., but each game uses them in a
            different role, Go for territory grabbing, and Gonnect for
            connection patterns. We don't know which is the best game, but Gonnect
            is not a subset of Go, they intersect in some places, but differ in
            others. What Go players are using when they play Gonnect is the knowledge they have in
            those common rules, but there are other parts in Gonnect that experience Gonnect players will get and play
            consistly better.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The same can be said about FIDE Chess and most
            Chess Variants. Why good chess players behave well in CVs? It's not
            because CVs are a subset of Chess (which is not the case for certain)
            but use the concepts of space, tactics, opening experience, and so
            on... to play those new games that share many features with FIDE Chess.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Another difference
            between Go and Gonnect is that Go is rather vague
            during the opening stages. This is because players can
            safely space pieces about the board to claim territory without too
            much concern for exact placement. In contrast the placement of
            pieces in Gonnect is critical from the very first move (as in Hex!)
            and a weak move can be attacked directly from the second move.</font></p>
