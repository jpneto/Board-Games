<p><font face="Arial">Some variants proposed by David Andrew: <i>You may wish to
try out the following variants: i) playing with 7 rather than 9 horses; ii) when
a piece has been hushed, either that you lose the move altogether or (worse)
that the piece that is hushed is shooed off - to the player's stable; and iii)
you keep the rule of safety, that prevents travelers in their home area being
shooed (off), but allow travelers to leave the home area again, taking the risk
that they will subsequently be shooed off, of course. Or, there may be other
variants that occur to you. </i></font></p>
