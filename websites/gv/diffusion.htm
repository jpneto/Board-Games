    <p><font face="Arial">Some notes from the author:</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>If there are too many disks, the game may not end because there are not
    enough points for the disks to spread out.  Some lattices, such as lattices with too many triangles (ie  three points, each joined to the other two) make
    it too easy for players to keep their disks alive by continually regrouping,
    so that the game never ends.  Here are two easily described types of lattices
    which seem to work well (but try others).  One is any lattice where each point
    is connected to exactly three others.  The other is a grid consisting of perpendicular families of straight lines, intersecting to form a tiling of
    boxes, with disks placed on the points of intersection.  Even three-dimensional grids seem to work, and even higher dimensional grids might work.<br>
    <br>
        For starters, try a five by five grid, and give each player five disks.
    A stronger player can be handicapped by giving him less disks than his opponent
    or by giving his opponent some extra moves in the beginning of the second stage.  It is possible to think up many variations of Diffusion.  For example,
    rank each player's disks by numbering them, and allow a disk to attack an enemy
    disk only if that enemy disk has the same or lower rank (you might decide that&nbsp;this restriction should only apply when attacking live disks, or only when attacking dead disks).</i></font>
