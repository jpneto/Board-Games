  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">According to David
desJardins, there are around 110.000 valid DAO positions (each position is, in
fact, eight positions under rotation and reflection). I tested the game using
Zillions, and after a tree search of over 60 million nodes (this. of course,
includes many repetitions) the program does not seem to give any tactical
advantage to either player (btw, the best proposed move was 1. b3-a3). This points that
DAO is probably a drawish game. Notice that this is not a game death sentence,
all two player abstract games end in one of three ways: win for 1st player, win
for 2nd player, or draw. What kills a game is to find a specific way to always
win or draw! More serious than this, is that after more than 70 turns played
almost by random (just avoiding direct winning moves) Zillions was not able to
defeat me (and Zillions plays very well on small search spaces like the 4x4 DAO
board)...</font></p>
