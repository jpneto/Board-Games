          with 12 stones each off-board.</font></li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>PIECE</b> -&nbsp; A piece is a stack

          piece jumps an adjacent (orthogonal) opponent piece, landing on the
          immediate cell that must be empty. Doing so, he captures the top stone
          of the jumped piece.</font>

        a piece like the one showed in the top left corner. Then, White drops a
        stone above it at cell [6], and black must make a second capture to
        square 3. After that white captures the top black stone of that stack
        and gains a better position.</font>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Freeling's words: <i>The game is a joint effort
by Ed van Zon, who got me interested in Lasca's way of capture in the first
place, and me. [...] Emergo derives from the Latin 'Luctor et Emergo', the motto
of the Dutch province of Zeeland, and meaning 'I wrestle and emerge'. You'll
find this name to be very appropriate. Emergo originates in the game <a href="lasca.htm">Lasca</a>,
invented by the legendary Chess world champion Emanuel Lasker. Lasker made a
classic mistake: he left a great idea where he found it, which was in the game
of Checkers. Thus he hooked it up to three interrelated principles of this game:
an initial position, a forward orientation&nbsp;and promotion. None of these is
needed to implement the essence of his idea, and applying them makes Lasca an
overcomplicated game. </i></font><font face="Arial" size="2">[<font SIZE="2"><a href="http://www.mindsports.net/Arena/Emergo/AboutEmergo.html">www.mindsports.net/Arena/Emergo/AboutEmergo.html</a></font>]</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">There's a variant of Emergo to the hexagonal
board, <a href="http://www.zillionsofgames.com/games/HexEmergo.html">HexEmergo</a> 
(the first player has a decisive advantage).</font></p>
