<p><font size="3" face="Arial">According
to Edward, Hex-Gomoku seems that when played quickly over the board, draws are
not universal.&nbsp; Played by two non-experts by email, it seems hard to force
a win. and played optimally, it might *not* be a draw, though it probably is.</font>
<font size="3" face="Arial">There are not enough directions to create attacks
(instead of the four possible direction in traditional <a href="moku.htm#gomoku">Gomoku</a>). There are some
games that tried to solve these problem, by adding more winning goals, like <a href="boku.htm">Boku</a>
(stones are removed by capture), <a href="andantino.htm">Andantino</a> (also win
by surround groups) or <a href="hexade.htm">Hexade</a> (more winnable shapes).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">When&nbsp;playing standard Gomoku, regardless of
the skill of the players,&nbsp;eventually someone&nbsp;will stumble upon a
forcing sequence and win.&nbsp;In Hex-Gomoku forcing sequences are less likely
to fall in&nbsp;one's lap. Maybe it's more a more strategic game - that is,
unless it truly is a draw with reasonable, conservative play.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In allowing diagonals rows in Hex-Gomoku, the
game turns out to have a very big advantage to first player. Perhaps a way to remedy
this, is to play on a smaller board (remove the two outer rows), and add the rule that the second plays also
wins if the first player is unable to create a row, if all cells are
occupied. But even so, the advantage seems overwhelming. Another possibility
(better imho) is
to introduce a 3-move equalizer, where the first player drops a stone, the
second player does the same, the first player drops a third stone, and then the
second player chooses his playing color. This should balance things as the
players gather knowledge of the game tactics and strategy.</font></p>

        Rows</strong><p>These are the extra three possible rows to win.</font></td>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Another nice variant is <b>SCORING HEX-MOKU</b>:
each 4 in-a-row values one point for the player. Wins the player that makes a 5
in-a-row or collects 7 points.</font></p>
