<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><a name="dual"></a>Another variant from Richard Hutnik (c) 1995,
is <b>Dual Tic-Tac-Toe</b>: Select a board with size NxM (N&gt;2 and M&gt;3).
Each player drops a stone of either color on an empty cell. The first player
that makes a (orthogonal or diagonal) 3 in-a-row of either color wins. If the
board gets full with no 3 in-a-rows, the game is a draw. Some variants are
possible: Misère (who makes a 3 in-a-row loses), use more than two colors, more
than two players...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><a name="king"></a>A 1985 variant called <b>
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/22452/King">King</a></b> by Jim 
Wilkinson, uses six pieces (three of each color) with a setup phase where both 
players alternatively drop their stones into empty cells (the first drop cannot 
be at the center). After all pieces are on board, players move one piece per 
turn into a (diagonal or orthogonal) adjacent empty cell until one of them make 
a friendly 3 in-a-row. There is a move exception in the rules: &quot;<i>except 
diagonally black-to-black</i>&quot; which may only make sense with a view of the 
board (which I do not have).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">There are several 3 in-a-rows in 3D (also 
check Qubic in the next section). Two of those are 1972's <b>

<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/8148">Trio</a></b>. In Rex, there are 
three set of three columns where it is possible to drop up to 3 pieces (of 
either color) on each. Wins the player that achieves the first 3 in-a-row 
(either vertically, horizontally or diagonally in 3D). In Trio, the board is a 
3x2x3 column pattern: </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/23318">Shift TicTacToe</a></b> is a 
1988 variant where: <i>Two players play Tic-Tac-Toe on a &quot;Connect Four&quot; type 
board (meaning placing a disk sends it to the bottom first). On their turn, a 
player can drop a disc in, or slide a row one space to the left or right. Since 
the board is a 3x3, slides can sometimes send pieces out of the unit and back 
into regular play. The first to achieve 3-in-a-row is the winner. </i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>Flip Tic-Tac-Toe</b> (a 2006 game by 
Stratagem Publishers) is played on a 4x4 board with 64 stackable stones (4 
colors with 16 stones each which I assume allows 2-4 players). Players are able 
to drop friendly stones (on empty cells or increasing stacks already on board), 
can move stacks (orthogonally to empty cells?) and also flip an entire stack 
(the bottom becomes to top). The goal is to make a 3 in-a-row of your own color.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>ROWS OF 4</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><a name="qubic"></a>There are several games that use 4 in-a-row,

One variant, called <b>QUBIC</b> (Parker Brothers, 1965) is played in 3D on four 4x4 boards, winning the first

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Both Patashnik (around 1980) and
independently Louis Victor Allis and Patrick Shoo (around 1991) solved Qubic
(first player win). Allis also solved Connect-4 (check this <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/allis88knowledgebased.html">paper</a>).

<b>
<a href="http://jeuxsoc.free.fr/index2.php?principal=/q/quigo.htm">Quintego</a></b> 
is a Connect-4 variant (with 5 columns): when a vertical column has six stones, 
and another stone is added, the bottom stone is removed and returned to the player's reserve (and all the 
others on that column move down). I think another name for this game is <b>
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/7476">Complica</a></b>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Another interesting variant is Gigamic's <b>
Quarto</b>. In this game, there are 16 different pieces (all combinations of 4 
boolean features: high/low, round/square, light/dark and solid/hollow). A player 
drops a piece on an empty cell <u>and selects the next piece which must be 
dropped by the opponent</u>! The first player to make a 4 in-a-row of any of the 
4 features, wins.</font></p>

very dangerous to make a single-ended 3, because if the next player has a double-ended
2, he will extend it to 3, leaving the 3rd player compelled to block the 1st, so
then there is only one player left to block the double 3. In the
      left diagram (white-black-red turns), Black should not play&nbsp;at [1]
      since Red drops at [2], then White is obliged to block the black 3

history of board-games other than chess</a>&quot; refers another set of rules
(game 3.7.1) consisting of two phases. First a drop phase where both players
drop an agreed number of stones, then a move phase where each player moves a
friendly stone into an adjacent (orthogonal) empty cell. Win by making an <u>orthogonal</u>
5 in-a-row. A similar variant (using twelve stones) states that each time a
(orthogonal or diagonal) 5 in-a-row is achieved (in the drop or move phase), the
player removes an enemy stone. The player which reduces the adversary to four
stones, wins the game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A
traditional variant called <b>Gomoku-Ninuki</b> adds an extra custodian capturing rule:
two enemy stones are captured when placed between two friendly stones, and a new
winning condition: a player also wins by capturing 10 stones. This game is also
known as</font><font size="3" face="Arial"> <a href="pente.htm">Pente</a>. <a href="http://kumquat.com/cgi-kumquat/funagain/12868?haV4MmkZ;;71"> Bolix</a>
is a similar variant played on a 5,10,5 hexagonal board, but where only one of
the two enemy stones is captured.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><a name="renju"></a>   In the end of the XIXth
    century, Japanese players started to change Go-moku and tried to create a more balanced
game (the first player, Black, has a tremendous advantage) which they called <b>RENJU</b>
(read the game's <a href="http://www.lemes.se/renju/r1rulhis.htm">history</a>). This
    was done by creating some restrictions in Black's move, namely:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial">Black cannot create a 2 open 3 lines (and so winning)</font></li>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial">Black cannot create a 2 closed 4 lines (and so winning again)</font></li>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial">Black cannot create an overline (i.e., 6 or more stone line)</font></li>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial">Black's 1st move is a the center board, and Black's 2nd move must be at cell distance greater than 2.</font></li>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial">White's 1st move is decided by Black.</font></li>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial">At White 2nd move, there is the PIE rule: White may decide to change sides!</font></li>

are a lot of variations of this simple game. A curious crossover between Gomoku and Reversi, called

invented by Roland Johansson at 1999 and can be defined as: wins who gets N
stones in-a-row in a NxN-board, using the rules of Reversi. Another variant,
with shifting rows, is <b> <a href="http://jeuxsoc.free.fr/sev/perplexu.htm">Perplexus</a></b>,
where the player may drop a stone or shift a row one cell to the right or left
(with 6 sliding rows of 7 stones placed within a base row of length 11). Other

<table border="0" width="80%">

<ul>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Pie rule -- First player moves, second player picks which side to play.</i></font></li>

	<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Neutral stones -- White gets one neutral stone. At any turn, she may play both a normal stone and her neutral stone. The neutral blocks both players.

	<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Blacks first stone is a 'half stone'. It may only be part of a winning *diagonal* row. If black forms a non-diagonal 5-in-a-row using that stone, the game continues.</i></font></li>

	<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Restricted double move. Black plays one stone; thereafter each player plays two stones that are not on the same row, column or diagonal within 5 spaces of each other.&nbsp;</i></font></li>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Add capturing rules as in Ninuki-renju or Keryo-Pente, etc. White can be required to capture fewer stones than black for the win. Alternately, captures have no effect on the outcome -- 5-in-a-row is the only way to win.&nbsp;</i></font></li>
	<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Black has fewer stones. Each player has a limited number of pieces, maybe only 15 or 20. Black has fewer pieces than white.

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Another
game from Edward (around 1995) is Progressive Gomoku: Black starts by dropping
one stone, then White drops two, then Black drops three... There is, however,
one restriction: during a drop sequence, all the stones must be mutually
non-adjacent (i.e., they cannot be adjacent to each other).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Next, two very playable variants (played in

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>DAGGER GOMOKU</b> - Same as Go-moku except

game. This extra freedom may provide a solution to the drawish feature of <a href="hexgomoku.htm"> gomoku in
hex boards</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Another related variant is to give each player just 12
stones. After the drop phase, the move phase begins: each player moves one stone to an adjacent

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Applying the progressive mutator (drop one stone
at the first move, then drop two, then drop three...)&nbsp; to Gomoku also
provides a very enjoyable game, if we add a restriction: <font SIZE="3"><i>No
two stones in a turn may finish in the same group</i> (i.e., a set of friendly
stones orthogonally or diagonally connected). If a fast game, but with lots of
tactical subtleties. This game should be played on an unlimited board.</font></font></p>

<a href="http://www.pentago.se/ENRules.pdf">Pentago</a></b>, a 5 in-a-row game 
where a 6x6 board is made out four separate 3x3 boards. Each player, on his 
turn, drops a friendly stone on an empty cell and then rotates one of the four 
small board 90 degrees in any direction (i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise). 
If all cells are occupied before a 5 in-a-row is achieved, the game is a draw. 
Also, if due to a rotation, both player get a 5 in-a-row, the game is also a 
draw. This idea suggests a hexagonal variant, where each cell on the board could 
be select as a pivot to rotate the adjacent 6 cells in either direction (a 
physical board would be difficult to make, it would be better to play this 
variant on a computer).</font></p>

On each turn, each player drops a friendly stone on an empty cell and then an 
enemy stone on an adjacent empty cell. If there is no additional empty cell to 
drop the enemy stone, the turn is invalid. As usual, a friendly 5 in-a-row wins 
the game.</font></p>

players agree on a certain pattern (eg, red-blue-yellow-green-green) and both 
try to make it. The first player that notices the winning pattern wins. The

each player should have his own sequence (or equal size) so the game would
