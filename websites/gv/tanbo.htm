  <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Initially, each player has 8 stones on the board as shown
    in the next image. The stones are interspersed and evenly spaced over the entire board.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial">After setting up this initial configuration, black makes
    the first move. (A &quot;move&quot; will always mean adding exactly one stone to the
    board. Stones are never actually moved from one point to another on the board.) Next white
    makes a move, and the players continue to take turns adding their stones to the board
    until one player wins. A newly added stone must &quot;connect&quot; to exactly one stone
    of the same color, which is already on the board. Two points &quot;connect&quot; if they
    are horizontally or vertically adjacent. Diagonally adjacent points do not connect.
    Players are not allowed to pass. You must add exactly one stone to the board during your
    turn.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3">When a single root becomes so constricted that it can
    no longer grow, the entire root is immediately removed from the board. The surrounding
    roots can then grow into the area vacated by the removed root. (That is what would happen
    to the example roots concerning cells [2], [3] and [5]). Sometimes two or more roots will
    run out of growing space simultaneously (the roots around cell [2]).A root becomes
    &quot;bounded&quot; when a move is made which completely deprives that root of root space.
    When a player makes a move which causes one or more roots to become bounded, he will be
    required to remove at least one of these bounded roots from the board, during his current
    turn. There are more rules, that consider all other possible cases, you can read them <a
    href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/tanbo.html">here</a> (there is also a <a
    href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/tanbo.faq.html">FAQ</a> available). To win, a player
    must eliminate all eight of his opponent's roots. One player will always win. It's
    impossible to repeat a board configuration in Tanbo. Therefore a game cannot result in a
    draw.&nbsp;</font> </font></p>
