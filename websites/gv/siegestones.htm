				empty cell.</font><ul>

				<li><font face="Arial">After the turn, the player places a 
				friendly stone on every tower he controls (this is just to help 
				figure out who owns what towers).</font><ul>

		<font face="Arial">The tower at b3 is also black. There are 3 white 
		stones and 3 black stones, but one white stone is adjacent to two 
		towers, which reduces its TR by one, so Black wins the tower by 15-14.</font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial">The tower at b1 is not controlled by White, because

		<font face="Arial">The tower at e4 is also not controlled by anyone, 
		since there is a tie of 5-5 between both players (each player only has 
		one adjacent stone).</font></p>
