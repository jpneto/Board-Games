    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"> Ji's initial idea can be summarized in
    the following desire: <i>[to build a game where]</i> <i>each piece can move
    [and capture] exactly as far orthogonally as there are pieces around it
    regardless who those pieces belongs to. </i>This very simple concept was
    worked out, and finally The Way of Go (or simply TWoG), a game that was
    seeking advise was born.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The game uses a 19x19 Go board, or for
    faster games a 13x13 board. The game starts with an empty board.</font></p>

        immobile, if it chooses to jump to g10. However if there is a white

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">TWoG has many subtleties. Each player must
try to surround chains of enemy stones in order to prevent them to escape when
an attack begins. Placing stones near enemy ones, limit their ranges and make
them more vulnerable. Grouping stones can be interesting to make longer attacks,
but their short range defenses become weaker. Ji opinion about groups: <i>In
fact in TWoG, I think it is unlikely anyone can build a sustained group that is
made by more than two pieces for this exact reason. So larger groups in TWoG
would be 'snaky' with many turns. And most of the time larger groups are only 'outlined'
like how in hex, many connections are not made until the end or when it was
advantageous to do so. So the threat to create a larger group is perhaps more
important.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Ji and me discussed an extra rule to TWoG,
which is the ability of stacking stones, giving rise to different ranges on the
same cell (since each stone of the stack may have different ranges). Adjacent
stacks interfere with each other. Ji is currently working on the game, on his <a href="http://www.planetlude.com">www.planetlude.com</a>
intriguing website.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Other possible interesting variant is the
ability to push a friendly stone placed on the destiny cell (and possibly
capturing adjacent enemy stones). In the figure, if White moves M8-M5, it would
push M5 to M4, and so capturing the Black stone at M4.</font></p>
