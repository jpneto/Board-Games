<p>Some notes from Bill Taylor:</p>
<pre wrap>First I note that the tactic of tank-like crawling is unstoppable:

x x x x . . .       . . x x . . .       . . . x x x x
 x # . . . . ----&gt;   . x x x x . ----&gt;   . . . x x .   ----&gt; etc

Now this is not necessarily a bad thing, though it may become a little
predictable, perhaps.  Nonetheless, it can be accounted for.
At first I thought the board was too small, and would need expanding,
but in fact we can *just* get it onto our board.  It appears to show
that the worst opening move is NOT in the corner, but on the side!</pre>
<pre wrap>    . . . , .  
   . . . , . .      Black's opening move here can be worked up into 
  . . . , . . .     a &quot;tank&quot; going along one of the two comma lines,
 . . . , . o . .    which means that the o move can be as shown,
. . . , . . . . .   or even slightly closer to the comma tracks.
 . , , , , , , ,  
  x , . . . . .     I think we could keep this in mind now.
   . . . . . .      I think the opening advantage is still very great,
    . . . . .       and the opener needs to go to this worst spot,
                    to get the best out of the inevitable(?) swap.
