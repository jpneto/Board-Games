  <blockquote>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><em><font size="2">&quot;In 1942, Danish poet &amp; mathematician Piet
    Hein invented a game now called Hex. Piet invented the game while he was contemplating the
    famous four-color theorem of topology. The theorem, then unproved, is that four colors are
    sufficient to make any map so that no two countries of the same color have a common
    boundary. The game was introduced as the Niels Bohr Institute. The game became popular in
    Denmark under the name Polygon. The game was printed on pads of paper; and sold as a paper
    &amp; pencil game. For months, Danish newspapers ran a series of &quot;Polygon&quot;
    problems. Albert Einstein kept the game on a shelf in his study.&quot;

    from<a href="mailto:lace@cix.compulink.co.uk"> Michael Leigh</a>, to
    equalize the game (he called it Vex):</font> <i><font size="3" face="Arial">We add an additional neutral
    stone, say red, which is given to the second player who has the option to place this
    stone on the board on any empty hex of his choice either before the first player makes his
    initial move or on any subsequent turn in addition to playing his black </font><font size="3" face="Arial">stone.&nbsp;Vex is a draw because white can always pretend the neutral
    </font><font size="3" face="Arial">stone is an extra white </font><font size="3" face="Arial">stone
    (which therefore cannot disadvantage him forcing him to lose) and black may place the neutral
    </font><font size="3" face="Arial">stone before the start of the game and then by assuming the
    stone to be black and playing the 'hex' winning strategy cannot be forced to lose either.
    By using a neutral stone and giving the second player the option when to play it we no longer need to 'know' which hexes are winning hexes for the
    first player in order to make the game fair.</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/Chameleon.html">
Chameleon</a> is a Hex variant, where both players may use stones of either 
color to achieve a vertical/horizontal connection, i.e.,&nbsp; one player wins 
if he makes a vertical connection, the other by a horizontal connection. If a 
move makes both connections, wins the mover. Words from Cameron Browne: <i>
Playing Chameleon is a constant tightrope act. In most connection games, each 
player can concentrate fully on pushing their connection as hard as possible. 
However in Chameleon players must keep their connections strong only in their 
direction or risk having them stolen. Players must consider the implications of 
each move very carefully. Chameleon has a similar feel to <a href="Jade.htm">
Jade</a> but with clearer goals.</i></font></p>
