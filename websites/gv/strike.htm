		<li><font face="Arial">Soldier - a single stone (the ones that start at

		<b>I</b> -&nbsp;On the first five turns, each player alternatively moves 
		one of his soldiers on top of another until both players have one King 
		and three Councilors.</font><ul>
		<li><font face="Arial">To make a Councilor the Player puts a 
		horizontally or vertically ADJACENT piece on top of a Soldier. </font>
		</li>
		<li><font face="Arial">To make a King the Player puts a horizontally or 
		vertically ADJACENT Soldier on top of a Councilor. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">note: at the end of this phase there will be 19 
		soldiers left for each side.</font></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><font face="Arial"><b>PHASE II</b> - On each turn, each player moves 
		a friendly piece.</font><ul>
		<li><font face="Arial">Captures from Soldiers and King are made by 
		jumping over an enemy piece (in moving range) and landing on the 
		immediate cell which must be empty.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">Councilors capture almost the same way, however 
		they can continue to move after the jump to any empty cell in the same 
		moving line.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">Captures are mandatory and multiple (pieces must 
		continue capturing if possible). </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">If there are capturing options, the sequence that 
		maximizes the capture of single stones must be chosen (e.g., a King 
		capture counts for three single captures).</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">Captured pieces are only removed at the end of 
		the capture sequence and cannot be jumped twice (so, a captured piece 
		acts as a block in the continuation of the capturing sequence).</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">After a Councilor is captured, the player can 
		optionally and <i>in the immediate next turn</i>, not move and instead 
		merge two adjacent soldiers into a new councilor.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">After a King is captured, the player <i>must</i> 
		use his next turn to create another King by placing any soldier on top 
		of a councilor (if a councilor was also captured in the same turn it 
		will be lost, because making a King takes precedence).</font></li>
		</ul>
    	</li>
		<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>GOAL</strong> - </font>
		<font face="Arial">A player that cannot create a new King loses the 
		game.</font><ul>
		<li><font face="Arial">A player also loses if he tries to avoid capture 
		by repeating the same sequence of moves for the third time.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial">If neither player can capture the other's King, 
		the game is drawn.</font></li>

is “STRIKE”. The suggestion made by Alex Randolph after playing the game was to 
change its’ name in a more appropriate one: <i>Fenix</i>&quot;</font></p>
