<p><font size="3" face="Arial">My impression is that the game is too drawish.
One thing that may help is to modify the trap rule, and a trapped stone should
be placed on the outer ring of the board, so in this way, trapping is a lot more
stronger. But I think this is not enough...</font> </p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Concerning my last sentence, Damian Walker 
	sent me the following comment:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="left"><i><font face="Arial">You mention in your page on Agon, or 
	Queen's Guard, that &quot;One thing that may help is to modify the trap rule, and 
	a trapped stone should be placed on the outer ring of the board, so in this 
	way, trapping is a lot more stronger.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	I have R C Bell's book Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations, and 
	Parlett's book The Oxford History of Board Games, and both books say that 
	this is how the game is played anyway.&nbsp; The exception is that when a queen 
	is trapped, she may be placed anywhere. <br>
	<br>
	They also propose a variant, though each is slightly different.&nbsp; Bell 
	proposes that the queens start in opposite corners as in the normal game, 
	but that the game starts with a placement phase, where players take turns to 
	place their guards, one at a time, in any hex on the board (the centre 
	excepted, presumably).&nbsp; Once this is done, play continues as normal.&nbsp; 
	Parlett suggests that the queens are also placed, before the guards, in the 
	same way.</font></i></p>
