<p><font face="Arial">Some words from the author: <i>This game may appear to be 
a simple alignment game. On the surface, this is true, but underneath it is also 
a move-elimination game.<br>
<br>
Remember that all pieces which are adjacent Pivots may not be moved. If a Pivot 
becomes adjacent another, both of them can not be moved the remainder of the 
game. Subsequently, any piece which is also adjacent or becomes adjacent is thus 
stuck for the game. Creating these types of situations can lead to a stalemate 
win. Just be careful of the opponent going for the three Pivot alignment.<br>
<br>
Another technique is the formations around a Pivot, or Pip. By strategically 
placing Pips of the same colour around a Pivot, or another Pip, the player has 
effectively created a 'frozen' piece. One that if moved would assure certain 
victory for the next player. After forming such a pattern, the player should 
attempt to reduce the number of moves available the opponent, forcing the 
movement of that particular piece. This works best when the Pivot is the center 
of such formation since it must be moved before the others.<br>
<br>
It is also possible to win the game without placing all the pieces on the board. 
The new introduction of a piece is also of great consideration. Even off of the 
playing field, that third piece can be dropped to complete an alignment.</i></font></p>
