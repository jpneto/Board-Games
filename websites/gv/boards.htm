  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">This game tends to be less strategic and more tactical. The average
  liberty of each piece is lower, so an attack to any individual piece or small group is
  more effective. Three moves are enough to capture one isolated piece. An stone in
  Atari cannot escape that easily, extending that piece only provides one extra liberty (not two
  in Go), so the opponent can maintain the threat (check the Atari race above).</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">A game called Rosette, invented by Mark Berger at 1975, is based on this
  concept. He created a special pattern, called rosette (a ring of stones covering a small
  hexagon) that has implicitly 2 eyes. Two games by Freeling are based in this idea: <a
  href="http://www.mindsports.net/Arena/CompleteGames/Territory/Medusa.html">Medusa</a> and <a
  href="http://www.mindsports.net/Arena/CompleteGames/Territory/Lotus.html">Lotus</a>. </font></p>

  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Other type of games can be played on this
  board. David Smith's <a href="http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/spangles.html">Spangles</a>
  use this triangular connections in the following rules: (a) On each turn, each
  player must drop a friendly stone adjacent to one or two stones (of either
  color) - there is an initial stone at the board center, (b) Wins the player
  that surrounds exactly one stone (of either color) with three friendly stones.</font></p>

<blockquote mstheme>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Given the other natural numbers, the game does
  not make sense for 1 connection (each piece is isolated and uncapturable) or 2 connections
  (each group of stones that makes contact with an opponent stone can be captured on the
  next move).</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">Boards with more than 6 connections tend to not have any tactical
  interest, since it is very difficult to capture any group of stones, except perhaps at the
  end of game. Even so, it is much more easy to connect a line of stones into two living
  eyes created on the edges, than to encircle and capture them.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" face="Arial">So, in my opinion, the only variations that make some sense are the 3,
  4, 5

    the central 5X5 points, leaving a symmetric toroid. The most interesting difference was
    the new kind of &quot;exterior&quot; corners produced by the hole. Of course, the hole
    also isolated Joseki that involved ladders from the diagonally opposite corner. The
    variant also has an advantage in that the board is easy to make - just cover the center
    with a piece of paper. All in all though, the variant seemed too simple. The center
    obviously was less important, and the games &quot;just&quot; involved a series of

<strong>Open

        Go needs a circular board and stones aprox. 1/20th of the board diameter.
        A stone may be placed if (a) does not overlap any other stone, and (b)
        there is space to eventually drop another stone touching the previous
one. In the figure, both players may drop a stone at cell [1] since it
        satisfies both conditions.</font><p><font face="Arial">If Black drops at [2], it will capture the
        White chain - they have no more liberty, i.e., there is no space left t<img border="0" src="boards/openGo.gif" align="right" width="253" height="253">o
        drop a friendly stone near the White chain.</font><p><font face="Arial">Ko fights as in [3] are
        not well defined on continuous Go (because the position may never repeat
itself, if we consider that we are dealing with real coordinates). This
        means that both players should be reasonable and accept the evidence of
        a Ko situation (this may be difficult in certain positions, if both
        captured stones may progressively shift into a non Ko situation - but
  I'm not sure if this can happen...)</font><p><font face="Arial">A
        stone structure like in [4] is alive, since no Black stones can enter in
        any of those two 'holes' without gaining any freedom!</font><p><font face="Arial">Wins the player
        that has the greater sum of placed stones (Chinese rules) plus the
        number of stones that can be placed on his territory!</font><p><font face="Arial">Greg proposes
        some mental challenges: Consider that Black stones are larger than White stones, who gets the advantage? Given a certain constant stone area,
        what should be the best shape for a stone? And what about using non-symmetric board shapes to prevent mirror tactics?</font>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Free Placement Go</b>, by <a href="mailto:pkarjala@paju.oulu.fi">Pekka Karjalainen</a></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">This variant is similar to Open Go, but is played on a square board.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The notion of connectivity is different (at least on the surface) and
        goes like this (Pekka's words): <i>Any two circles are defined to be
        connected if a line can be drawn between their center points that does
        not intersect any other circle. Also, it must not be intersected by a
        line drawn between two circles of opponent's color that is shorter or
        of equal length to this first line.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Wins the player that has the greater area of territory. This is
        harder to compute (strange polygon areas) and may cause problems if the
        players does not count any placed stones or captured enemies!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><a href="mailto:sjoh0780@sable.ox.ac.uk">Henry Segerman</a> has
        another variant called<b> Continuous Go</b>, where two stones are
        connected if and only if they touch each other. He generalized the idea
        into <a href="http://www.nrinstruments.demon.co.uk/topologo/topologo.html">Topological
        Go</a>  [but beware, that website is not for the weak of heart].</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><a href="mailto:John.Rickard@virata.com">John Rickard</a> proposes
        the same capturing rule as Open Go, but the counting method is different:
        wins the player with more stones in the board. That means the endgame
        will be longer. He also proposes that if there is no rule to pass, the
        first player that cannot place a stone, looses!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I believe that all these ideas are very similar and they reflect
        basically the same game. Even the different winning conditions would
        give the same result on any typical endgames. I found, however, a big
        problem with these continuous variants, how to play them? If we use a
computer, we must restrict ourselves to limited rationales, and that
        means that the board is not continuous and approaches discrete Go on an hexagonal
board.<i> </i>If played face to face, it will be very hard to place the
        stones without moving the ones already placed. The exact position of a stone can be
decisive!</font>
