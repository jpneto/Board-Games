    played on a 11x11 square board. This is the initial configuration. Each player has a set
    of 16 stones. Players start with 9 stones on the board with 7 held in reserve. Players
    also have &quot;markers&quot; explained later</font><font size="2">. </font></font></p>

        your stones and one enemy stone. So you have three &quot;squaring&quot; stones and one
        &quot;squared&quot; stone. The enemy &quot;squared&quot; stone is then removed from the
        board and replaced with one of your own reserve stones. Removed stones are returned to
        their original owners. Players do not take ownership of each others stones</font><font

        enemy &quot;home plate&quot;, you win. A player's home plate consists of the three points
        in the middle of his side of the board. </font></font></font mstheme></td msthemelist>

            single dot face up. You can put it anywhere on the board. The location doesn't matter;
            it's just showing that you made one non-aggressive sideways move. If your marker is
            already on the board with the single dot face up, and you make a non-aggressive sideways
            move, you must flip your marker over so that the two-dot face is showing. This shows that
            you have made two consecutive, non-aggressive sideways moves. A non-aggressive sideways
            move is a sideways move which does not kill any enemy stones.</font></font mstheme></td msthemelist>

            sideways move. An aggressive sideways move kills enemy stones. Once you have made a
            forward, diagonally forward, or aggressive sideways move, you must remove your marker from
            the board. It doesn't matter if it is showing a single dot or two dots; a forward move
