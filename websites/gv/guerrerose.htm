		If White's turn, then he could attack by phalanx the black soldier at 
		f6, capturing it (since it would be pushed out the board). However, a 
		more urgent move is to remove the adversary winning threat by pushing 
		out the black stone at c3. White cannot win the game with an attack by 
		support against the black castle (only attacks by phalanx are permitted 
		to win).<p>
		If Black's turn, the best move was to win by an phalanx attack which 
		would capture the white castle. However, White has other attacking 
		options, for eg, attack by support against d4 by moving d3 to d4 (white 
		d4 is adjacent to two contiguous black soldiers). But this last move 
		would be very bad, since it would give White the chance to win in the 
		next move.</font></td>
