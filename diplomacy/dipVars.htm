Fiascomacy (Martin Edwardes) 
</A> </CENTER> </B> <P>
A player for three or more players played on a standard map. In addition to the standard rules, each player starts the game with 8 "Political Factors" (PFs) which are allocated among the seven great powers. These allocations are permanent and PFs may not be reassigned. A player submits orders for all powers to which that player has allocated PFs. Moves for each unit are determined according to a voting scheme based on the number of PFs in support of each order. After each move phase, powers receive two additional PFs to allocate.

In this variant, the victory conditions are modified so that in order to win one must capture certain supply centers, called goals. Players may receive spies, which allow them to determine the goals of other players. The number of goals each power has can vary, but they affect the number of spies allocated to a power.

A variant that can be combined with most other variants when you are short one or more players for a game. Instead of having the "vacant" powers holding as the standard rulebook suggests, each turn a different player controls a vacant power and is allowed to issue its orders.

This variant can be played on the standard map or a variety of other maps. This variant brings the concept of multiple forces to the game of Diplomacy. Units may merge into multiple forces (which can subsequently be split). Multiple forces can attack with the strength of multiple units, and distribute support into different spaces. Standard Diplomacy rules apply, plus rules that govern merging, splitting, and other adjudication for multiple forces.

Payola (Manus Hand and John Woolley) 
</A> </CENTER> </B> <P>
This variant can be played on the standard map or any other map. In this variant, players receive money (silver pieces) every year based on supply center holdings. Rather than issuing orders for one's own units, players make offers to any number of units on the map; offers consist of a desired move and a bribe amount. The order that a unit actually attempts is determined according to the highest bribe (or combination of like bribes) received by the unit. Standard Diplomacy rules and a set of rules relating to money and to bribe adjudication apply.

Vain Rats (Richard Sharp, Keith Loveys and Des Langford) 
</A> </CENTER> </B> <P>
This variant can be played with the standard map as well as a variety of other maps. Each player is given two special abilities that affect play in different ways. Examples include "Extra Petrol" which allows one unit each season to move an extra space, and "King" which allows one unit each season to be designated as having double strength. Aside from these abilities, standard Diplomacy rules apply.

Vote (Steve Doubleday)

This variant is designed for a large number of players, divided into seven teams with a captain, each representing one of the great powers. The rules are written for a specific group of players but can easily be adapted to any group. Units are ordered based on the result of a voting system.

This variant is played on the standard map. Players are allowed to conduct negotiations before the initial builds. Neutral supply centers are garrisoned with units. Each turn, players may submit orders for neutral units, which will follow the most popular order if there is
one. <a href="http://devel.igo.org/DipPouch/Online/variants/woe.html">http://devel.igo.org/DipPouch/Online/variants/woe.html</a>
